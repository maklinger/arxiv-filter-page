  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04990v1">Probing millisecond magnetar formation in binary neutron star mergers through X-ray follow-up of gravitational wave alerts</a>
</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Clara Plasse, Alexis Reboul-Salze, Jérome Guilet, Diego Götz, Nicolas Leroy, Raphaël. Raynaud, Matteo Bugli, Tito Dal Canton</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xue-Zhao Chang, HouJun Lü, Zhao-Wei Du, Xing Yang, En-Wei Liang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($σ$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $σ>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $σ$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $σ$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\%, 1.5\%, and 3.5\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations. We propose three distinct non-simultaneous survey strategies, among them an active galactic nuclei (AGN) strategy for long-term monitoring of $\sim$200 AGN with $<$1-day cadence. In this paper, we present the predicted sensitivity of the instrument and outline the various science cases it is designed to explore.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Matteo Pracchia, Om Sharan Salafia</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle τ_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $τ_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Haojia Xia, Shichuan Chen, Hong-Bo Li, Enping Zhou, Ren-Xin Xu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of the central engine powering short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remains a key open question in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xiao-Yan Li, Tong Liu, Bao-Quan Huang, Chen Deng</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Plateau features are frequently observed in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), yet their physical origins remain under debate. In this work, we compile a sample of 124 GRBs with known redshifts and simultaneous X-ray and optical afterglow observations. We categorize them into four subsets based on the existence of plateaus and the bands in which they appear. Namely, Dataset 1: plateaus are detected simultaneously in both X-ray and optical bands (75 bursts); Dataset 2: plateaus are only in X-rays (15 bursts); Dataset 3: plateaus appear only in the optical (17 bursts); Dataset 4: no plateaus in either band (17 bursts). We employ these datasets to test the applicability of the energy-injection model by examining whether the temporal decay index $α$ and the spectral index $β$ of GRB afterglows simultaneously satisfy the closure relations in X-ray and optical bands. We find that 47 bursts of Dataset 1 simultaneously obey the closure relations in both bands under the conditions of the electron spectral index $p>2$ and the injection parameter $q\in (0, 0.5)$, and 69 of the dataset for $p>1$ and $q\in (0, 0.8)$, providing a strong support for the energy-injection interpretation. However, for Datasets 2 and 3, although $α$ and $β$ of the plateaus mostly satisfy the closure relations, those in the other band show significant deviations, which implies that bursts with a single-band plateau are inconsistent with the interpretation of energy injection. Furthermore, we also compare the isotropic X-ray energy of plateaus with the rotational energy budget of millisecond magnetars.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tomoki Wada, Shigeo S. Kimura</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the gamma-ray spectrum in the MeV range arising from electron-positron pair annihilation in fireballs associated with magnetar giant flares (MGFs), motivated by the recent observation of a MeV gamma-ray line feature in a bright gamma-ray burst, GRB~221009A. We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Gerardo Urrutia, Agnieszka Janiuk</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Long gamma-ray bursts (lGRB) are produced by relativistic jets arising from the collapse of massive stars. Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xue-Zhao Chang, HouJun Lü, Jia-Ming Chen, En-Wei Liang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($Γ_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($σ_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($η$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $Γ_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+σ_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($η\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($σ_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $ν\barν$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xueying Shao, He Gao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Liang Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Over the past two decades, the \textit{Swift} and \textit{Fermi} missions have identified a rare class of ``double-trigger'' gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that produce two independent trigger events. These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($τ_{\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.</p>

  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21669v1">VLBI Diagnostics of Off-axis Jets in Radio Flares of Tidal Disruption Events</a>
</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tatsuya Matsumoto</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio.

  </h3>
  

  
  <p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tatsuya Matsumoto</p>
  

  
  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We performed a search for fast X-ray transients (FXTs), with durations longer than one second and less than one day, through data of the Wide Field Camera (WFC) instrument onboard the BeppoSAX X-ray observatory collected between June 1996 and April 2002. (..) We focused our search on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray flares from high-mass X-ray binaries and stellar flares, while Type-I and II X-ray bursts from Galactic neutron stars were excluded. 149 such fast transient events were detected. 63 of these are new to the literature. 38 flares are identified with 22 nearby stars. Three stars have never been seen flaring before in X-rays or optical (NLTT 51688, GR Dra and UCAC4 255-003783). We find that the MeV transient GRO J1753+57 is most likely the same object as GR Dra rather than an AGN as previously thought. Eleven flares were detected from known high-mass X-ray binaries with irregular wind accretion (four of which are of the subclass of supergiant fast X-ray transients). 100 GRBs were identified of which 24 have not been published before. We classify 37% of the X-ray detected GRBs as XRFs with relatively large X-ray to gamma-ray flux ratio, gamma-rays being measured with the BeppoSAX Gamma Ray Burst Monitor. The duration/spectral hardness distribution of all FXTs is bimodal, separating the group roughly in transients shorter and longer than 1 ksec and with relatively hard and soft spectra, respectively. We identify the 'short' FXTs as GRBs and XRFs and the `long' FXTs as flares from nearby late-type stars and X-ray binaries.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">S. Bala, P. Veres, A. Goldstein, R. Sonawane, R. Samanta, S. Iyyani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($β_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $β_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $β_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe. The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Jonathan Granot, Hagai B. Perets, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Brendan O'Connor</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB$\;$250702B is the longest GRB recorded so far, with multiple gamma-ray emission episodes spread over a duration exceeding $25\;$ks and a weaker soft X-ray pre-peak $\sim1\;$day gradually rising emission. It is offset from its host galaxy center by $\sim5.7\;$kpc, and displays a long-lived afterglow emission in radio to X-ray. Its true nature is unclear, with the two leading candidate classes of objects being a peculiar type of ultra-long GRB and a tidal disruption event (TDE) by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). Here, we consider the latter, mTDE origin. We model the afterglow data, finding a stratified external density profile $\propto r^{-k}$ with $k=1.60\pm0.17$, consistent with Bondi accretion of the interstellar medium (of initial number density $n_{\rm ISM}=n_0\;{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and sound speed $c_s=c_{s,6}10^6\;{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$) for which $n(r)\approx n_{\rm ISM}(r/R_{\rm B})^{-3/2}$ within the Bondi radius $R_{\rm B}$. Moreover, we use the implied density normalization to infer the IMBH mass within this model, finding $M_\bullet\approx\left(6.55^{+3.51}_{-2.29}\right)\times10^3\,n_0^{-2/3}\,c_{s,6}^{2}(1+\mathcal{M}^2)\;M_\odot$ where $\mathcal{M}\equiv v_{\rm BH}/c_s$ is the IMBH's Mach number relative to the ISM. Together with an upper limit on $M_\bullet<\frac{c^3}{G}\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z} \lesssim5\times10^4\,M_\odot$ from the source-frame minimum variability time $t_{\rm MV,src}\!=\!\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z}\!\approx\!0.5\;$s this implies $v_{\rm BH}\lesssim 28\,n_0^{1/3}\;{\rm km\;s^{-1}}$. We show that a mTDE of a main-sequence star (but not of a white dwarf) can explain the duration and energetics of GRB$\;$250702B. The gradual rise to the peak may be caused by gradual circularization and accretion disk buildup, leading to an increase in the jet's power and Lorentz factor.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the counterpart of EP240801a, at z=1.67, the first fast X-ray transient (FXT) identified as an X-ray flash (XRF) by the Einstein Probe (EP) and Fermi-GBM. Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Manuele Maistrello, Romain Maccary, Cristiano Guidorzi</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present FAST-MEPSA, an optimised version of the MEPSA algorithm developed to detect peaks in uniformly sampled time series affected by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Kanako Nakama, Kazumi Kashiyama, Nobuhiro Shimizu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Both observational and theoretical studies indicate that the central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is intrinsically time-variable, implying jet inhomogeneity. A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$σ$ region of the galaxy mass model.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs.

We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Compact binary mergers and the collapse of massive stars can produce intense transients observable across high-energy wavelengths.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">H. Dereli-Bégué, A. Pe'er, D. Bégué, F. Ryde, A. Gowri</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a "plateau" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a "plateau" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xiao-Hong Zhao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $γ$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $γ$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $γ$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{γ,{\rm iso}}\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\sim5\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Chakraborty, L. Resmi, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Amit Kumar, Sayan Chakrabarti, Santabrata Das</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(σ\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(σ\lesssim10^{-4})$. Bell-dominated shocks efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\max}\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell-dominated regime. On the other hand, Weibel-dominated shocks efficiently generate both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\mathrm{max}}\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Sandeep Kumar Acharya</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass. In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Parth Bambhaniya, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">High-energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, X-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts are powered by mechanisms that convert gravitational or rotational energy into radiation, jets, and relativistic outflows. Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The rate of observed gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) indicates the existence of more than one short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) similar to GW/sGRB 170817A within the total gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) recorded by satellite detectors such as BATSE, Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT). We investigated sGRBs in the Fermi-GBM dataset based on their MeV-GeV $γ$-ray emission features, to identify sGRBs similar to sGRB 170817A. Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We analyze a sample of\textit{ Swift} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with extended emissions in $γ$-rays and/or X-ray plateaus that may be driven by magnetars. Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the $γ$-ray isotropic energy as $L_X\varpropto T_a^{-1.13}E_{γ,iso}^{0.74}$, which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.</p>

Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs but GRB 211024B have reasonable periods and majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multi-formation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Lin Lan, He Gao, Litao Zhao, Shunke Ai, Jie Lin, Long Li, Lang Xie, Li-Ping Xin, Jian-Yan Wei</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetars with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equations of state. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has revolutionized the field of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, several important questions remain to be answered. One of these is the nature of the compact remnant leftover by GW170817 (short- or long-lived NS versus black hole). A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks. This framework can be used to identify the most promising regions of parameter space in which to concentrate search efforts, helping design future search strategies to optimally balance search sensitivity and related parameter space gridding schema against computational cost.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 250114A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) which triggered the Swift/BAT with a spectroscopic high-redshift at $z = 4.732$. The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Pragyan Pratim Bordoloi, Shubh Mittal, Shabnam Iyyani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is commonly attributed to non-thermal radiation processes operating in the optically thin regions of a relativistic outflow. Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $Γ\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\%$-$20\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $δ\sim 1.8$. The derived Comptonisation parameters indicate moderate $y$ values ($\sim 1$-$3$), optical depths $τ\sim 0.2$-$0.6$, and dissipation radii just above the photosphere, consistent with mildly relativistic ($γ_{\min} \sim 1.2$-$2.6$), photon-dominated, low-magnetic-field dissipation environments. Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">C. R. Das</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Strange quark matter (SQM) is considered a possible true ground state of QCD at high densities. This idea motivates research on exotic compact objects and certain cosmic-ray phenomena. For instance, the remnant HESS J1731-347 contains a low-mass neutron star, about $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ $M_\odot$ and $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km in radius, making it a strong candidate for a strange quark star.

This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models. Data from H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT, MAGIC-II, and CTA were used to set limits on spectral features and possible fluxes. Detecting narrow $γ$-ray lines will require improved instrument sensitivity.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Martyna Chruślińska, Mirko Curti, Ruediger Pakmor, Annalisa De Cia, Jorryt Matthee, Aniket Bhagwat, Stephanie Monty</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Due to their different nucleosynthetic origin, a stellar population produces oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) on different timescales and their relative abundance can deviate strongly from solar. Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived <[Fe/H]> from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers).</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Suo-Ning Wang, Bin-Bin Zhang, Rubén García Benito</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events -- including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 < z < 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Accurate spectral analysis of high-energy astrophysical sources often relies on comparing observed data to incident spectral models convolved with the instrument response. However, for Gamma-Ray Bursts and other high-energy transient events observed at high count rates, significant distortions (e.g., pile-up, dead time, and large signal trailing) are introduced, complicating this analysis. We present a method framework to address the model dependence problem, especially to solve the problem of energy spectrum distortion caused by instrument signal pile-up due to high counting rate and high-rate effects, applicable to X-ray, gamma-ray, and particle detectors. Our approach combines physics-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a model-independent spectral inversion technique. The MC simulations quantify instrumental effects and enable correction of the distorted spectrum. Subsequently, the inversion step reconstructs the incident spectrum using an inverse response matrix approach, conceptually equivalent to deconvolving the detector response. The inversion employs a Convolutional Neural Network, selected for its numerical stability and effective handling of complex detector responses. Validation using simulations across diverse input spectra demonstrates high fidelity. Specifically, for 27 different parameter sets of the brightest gamma-ray bursts, goodness-of-fit tests confirm the reconstructed spectra are in excellent statistical agreement with the input spectra, and residuals are typically within $\pm 2σ$. This method enables precise analysis of intense transients and other high-flux events, overcoming limitations imposed by instrumental effects in traditional analyses.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The observable characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mainly determined by the jet propagation within the disk. In the massive collapsar scenario, we consider that the mass and metallicity of progenitor stars can significantly affect the jet durations and luminosities, which in turn influence whether the jet can break out from AGN disks. For the cases with low metallicity, massive stars tend to keep their massive envelopes. Thus the hyperaccretion of these envelopes onto the newborn black holes (BHs) can prolong the activity duration of the central engine, thereby allowing the jets to potentially break out from the disks. For successful jets, we further study their prompt emission and afterglows for different supermassive BHs and locations and discuss the detectability of these signals by instruments such as \emph{Swift} and Einstein Probe.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The General Coordinates Network (GCN) is NASA's time-domain and multi-messenger alert system. GCN distributes two data products - automated ``Notices,'' and human-generated ``Circulars,'' that report the observations of high-energy and multi-messenger astronomical transients. The flexible and non-structured format of GCN Circulars, comprising of more than 40500 Circulars accumulated over three decades, makes it challenging to manually extract observational information, such as redshift or observed wavebands. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the automated parsing of transient reports. We develop a neural topic modeling pipeline with open-source tools for the automatic clustering and summarization of astrophysical topics in the Circulars database. Using neural topic modeling and contrastive fine-tuning, we classify Circulars based on their observation wavebands and messengers. Additionally, we separate gravitational wave (GW) event clusters and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from the Circulars database. Finally, using the open-source Mistral model, we implement a system to automatically extract gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshift information from the Circulars archive, without the need for any training. Evaluation against the manually curated Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRB table shows that our simple system, with the help of prompt-tuning, output parsing, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), can achieve an accuracy of 97.2 % for redshift-containing Circulars. Our neural search enhanced RAG pipeline accurately retrieved 96.8 % of redshift circulars from the manually curated database. Our study demonstrates the potential of LLMs, to automate and enhance astronomical text mining, and provides a foundation work for future advances in transient alert analysis.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Razzaque, JC. Joshi, S. Majumder, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.</p>

This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Qin-Mei Li, Qi-Bin Sun, Sheng-Bang Qian, Si-Yuan Zhu, Fu-Xing Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of the Universe and its material content remains one of the most fundamental questions in science. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z < 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Chen Deng, Yong-Feng Huang, Abdusattar Kurban, Jin-Jun Geng, Fan Xu, Xiao-Fei Dong, Hao-Xuan Gao, En-Wei Liang, Liang Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibiting a plateau phase provide valuable insights into the post-merger activity of their central engines. Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray--only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data.

However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements.

The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Filip Alamaa, Frédéric Daigne</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Radiation-mediated shocks (RMS) occurring below the photosphere in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet could play a crucial role in shaping the prompt emission. In this paper, we study the time-resolved signal expected from such early shocks. An internal collision is modeled using a 1D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulation and the photon distributions in the resulting forward and reverse shocks, as well as in the common downstream region, are followed to well above the photosphere using a designated RMS simulation code. The light curve and time resolved spectrum of the resulting single pulse is computed taking into account the emission at different optical depths and angles to the line-of-sight. For the specific case considered, we find a light curve consisting of a short pulse lasting $\sim 0.1$ s for an assumed redshift of $z = 1$. The efficiency is large, with $\approx 23$% of the total burst energy being radiated. The spectrum has a complex shape at very early times, after which it settles into a more generic shape with a smooth curvature below the peak energy, $E_p$, and a clear high-energy power law that cuts off at $\sim 5$ MeV in the observer frame. The spectrum becomes narrower and softer at late times with $E_p$ steadily decreasing during the pulse decay from $E_p \approx 250~$keV to $E_p \approx 100$ keV. The low-energy index, $α$, decreases during the bright part of the pulse from $α\approx -0.5$ to $α\approx -1$, although the low-energy part is better fit with a broken power law when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The high-energy power law is generated by the reverse shock at low optical depths ($τ< 30$) and has an index that decreases from $β\approx -2$ to $β\approx -2.4$. These results provide support for RMSs as potential candidates for the prompt emission in GRBs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We introduce the PanRadio Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) program carried out on the Australia Telescope Compact Array: a systematic, multi-year, radio survey of all southern $\textit{Swift}$ GRB events, comprehensively following the multi-frequency evolution of their afterglows from within an hour to years post-burst. We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of the long-duration (collapsar) GRB 230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB 230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V=2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to the jet break, showing no evidence for evolutions of the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle ${\sim}2.1^{\circ}$, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle of $\gtrapprox 35^{\circ}$. The PanRadio GRB program will establish a sample of comprehensively followed GRBs, where a rigorous inspection of their microphysical and dynamical parameters can be performed, thereby revealing the diversity of features in their outflows and environments.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We introduce the PanRadio Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) program carried out on the Australia Telescope Compact Array: a systematic, multi-year, radio survey of all southern $\textit{Swift}$ GRB events, comprehensively following the multi-frequency evolution of their afterglows from within an hour to years post-burst. We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of the long-duration (collapsar) GRB 230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB 230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V=2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to the jet break, showing no evidence for evolutions of the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Agnieszka Janiuk, Joseph Saji, Gerardo Urrutia</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.</p>

We present here the discovery of GRB\,240419A, its redshift determination of $z=5.178$, its early-time optical polarimetry observations, and the multi-wavelength monitoring of its afterglow. We analysed three epochs of polarimetric data to derive the early-time evolution of the polarisation.

The multi-band afterglow at the time of the polarisation measurements is consistent with a forward shock (FS), while the earlier evolution at $t-t_0\lesssim700$ s can be associated with the interplay between the forward and the reverse shocks or with energy injection.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yu-Chen Hua, Xiao-Jun Bi, Yu-Ming Yang, Peng-Fei Yin</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity theories would manifest as an energy-dependent speed of light, which may potentially distort the observed temporal profile of photons from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances. The dispersion cancellation (DisCan) algorithm offers a powerful methodology for investigating such effects by employing quantities such as Shannon entropy, which reflects the initial temporal characteristics. In this study, we apply the DisCan algorithm to search for LIV effects in the LHAASO observations of GRB 221009A, combining data from both the WCDA and KM2A detectors that collectively span an energy range of $\sim 0.2-13$ TeV. Our analysis accounts for the uncertainties from both energy resolution and temporal binning. We derive $95\%$ confidence level lower limits on the LIV energy scale of $E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{19}~\text{GeV}>21.1$ (13.8) for the first-order subluminal (superluminal) scenario, and $E_{\rm{QG}}/10^{11}~\text{GeV}> 14.9$ (13.7) for the second-order subluminal (superluminal) scenario.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shan-Shan Zhao, Ru-Sen Lu, Lei Liu, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The 1.3 mm ground-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), is limited by the Earth's diameter and can image the supermassive black hole (SMBH) shadows of only M87* and Sgr A*. Extending the array with an assumed lunar-based telescope could achieve $\sim 0.85\ μ$as angular resolution at 230 GHz, enabling black hole shadow detection for a larger SMBH sample. The concept is motivated by space VLBI missions and lunar exploration, including the ongoing Lunar Orbit VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) aboard QueQiao-2 (Chang'E-7) and the planned International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). We assess shadow detectability for 31 SMBH with predicted large angular sizes, exploring different telescope location and antenna size. Assuming a telescope at the lunar antipode, we simulate the Moon-Earth (u,v) coverage and show that source geometry relative to the Moon's orbit determines whether the primary indicator of shadow, first visibility null, can be sampled. Using a geometric ring model, we identify six high-priority targets: M104, NGC 524, PGC 049940, NGC 5077, NGC 5252, and NGC 1052. Shadows of M104, NGC 5077, and NGC 1052 are detectable with a 5 m lunar-based telescope; PGC 049940 requires 20 m; NGC 524 and NGC 5252 require 100 m. Photon ring detection for Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1600, and M31 is possible if space telescopes fill the baseline coverage gaps and sensitivity requirements are met.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Roman N. Burridge, Geoffrey C. Bower</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of black hole mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond SgrA* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole M87* depict an asymmetric ring of emission. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Himanshu Verma, Priyanka Sarmah, Joseph Silk, Kingman Cheung</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The resolution of photon rings of Sgr~A$^*$ and M87 is the next milestone of upcoming EHT-like interferometries. We extend the formalism developed in our previous work~\cite{Verma:2023hes} to constrain primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter using microlensing-induced distortions of black hole shadows. Building upon the theoretical framework for microlensing of photon rings, we apply this methodology to both Sgr A* and M87, considering multiple PBH populations: (i) PBH dark matter spikes around central supermassive black holes, (ii) NFW halo contributions in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, and (iii) foreground Milky Way PBH dark matter affecting M87* observations. The microlensing signal manifests as a time-dependent asymmetry and deformation of the photon ring, providing the most sensitive observable for lensing effects. We assess the detectability of these signatures with future EHT-like interferometers. Our analysis reveals that M87* provides the strongest constraints on PBH dark matter. We show that the absence of photon-ring asymmetries in observations with angular resolution of order $0.1\,μ{\rm as}$ can constrain PBHs in the mass range $10^{-5}\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, with maximal sensitivity near $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{3}\,M_\odot$, for PBH dark matter fractions as small as $f_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-2}$.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$α$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alejandro Cruz-Osorio, Claudio Meringolo, Christian M. Fromm, Yosuke Mizuno, Sergio Servidio, Antonios Nathanail, Ziri Younsi, Luciano Rezzolla</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The XRISM/Resolve microcalorimeter directly measured the gas velocities in the core of the Virgo Cluster, the closest example of AGN feedback in a cluster. This proximity allows us to resolve the kinematic impact of feedback on scales down to 5 kpc. Our spectral analysis reveals a high velocity dispersion of $σ_v$=262 (+45 / -38) km/s near the AGN, which steeply declines to ~60 km/s between 5 and 25 kpc in the northwest direction. The observed line-of-sight bulk velocity in all regions is broadly consistent with the central galaxy, M87, with a mild trend toward blueshifted motions at larger radii. Systematic uncertainties have been carefully assessed and do not affect the measurements. The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The XRISM/Resolve microcalorimeter directly measured the gas velocities in the core of the Virgo Cluster, the closest example of AGN feedback in a cluster. This proximity allows us to resolve the kinematic impact of feedback on scales down to 5 kpc. Our spectral analysis reveals a high velocity dispersion of $σ_v$=262 (+45 / -38) km/s near the AGN, which steeply declines to ~60 km/s between 5 and 25 kpc in the northwest direction. The observed line-of-sight bulk velocity in all regions is broadly consistent with the central galaxy, M87, with a mild trend toward blueshifted motions at larger radii. Systematic uncertainties have been carefully assessed and do not affect the measurements. The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Mohsen Khodadi, Behnam Pourhassan, Emmanuel N. Saridakis</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the presence and spatial characteristics of the jet base emission in M87* at 230 GHz, enabled by the enhanced uv coverage in the 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The addition of the 12-m Kitt Peak Telescope and NOEMA provides two key intermediate-length baselines to SMT and the IRAM 30-m, giving sensitivity to emission structures at scales of $\sim250~μ$as and $\sim2500~μ$as (0.02 pc and 0.2 pc). Without these baselines, earlier EHT observations lacked the capability to constrain emission on large scales, where a "missing flux" of order $\sim1$ Jy is expected. To probe these scales, we analyzed closure phases, robust against station-based gain errors, and modeled the jet base emission using a simple Gaussian offset from the compact ring emission at separations $>100~μ$as. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian feature centered at ($Δ$RA $\approx320~μ$as, $Δ$Dec $\approx60~μ$as), a projected separation of $\approx5500$ AU, with a flux density of only $\sim60$ mJy, implying that most of the missing flux in previous studies must arise from larger scales. Brighter emission at these scales is ruled out, and the data do not favor more complex models. This component aligns with the inferred direction of the large-scale jet and is consistent with emission from the jet base. While our findings indicate detectable jet base emission at 230 GHz, coverage from only two intermediate baselines limits reconstruction of its morphology. We therefore treat the recovered Gaussian as an upper limit on the jet base flux density. Future EHT observations with expanded intermediate-baseline coverage will be essential to constrain the structure and nature of this component.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yuh Tsunetoe, Dominic W. Pesce, Ramesh Narayan</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We explore the impact of "slow-light" radiative transfer - i.e., general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations in which the simulated fluid evolves while light rays are propagating through it - in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of the M87 jet. Because the plasma in the jet-launching region is accelerated to relativistic velocities, and because the jet in M87 is nearly aligned with the line of sight (offset by ~17 degrees), a slow-light treatment is important for accurately modeling the observable structure. While fast-light images exhibit prominent helical or loop-shaped features in the jet - which we associate with narrow bundles of magnetic field lines - these features become stretched and smoothed-out in slow-light images. Our slow-light images instead exhibit a double-edged, cone-like morphology that is more consistent with observations of M87 than corresponding fast-light images. We find that the radius at which the plasma transitions from sub-relativistic to relativistic velocities is imprinted on slow-light images via a transition from loop-dominated at small distances from the black hole to edge-dominated at a larger distance, with the loop-edge transition occurring at larger distances for lower black hole spins. The jet image dynamics also vary with black hole spin, with low-spin models producing jets that exhibit substantial "wobbling", while high-spin models produce jets that are straighter and more stable in time. The spin-dependent jet morphology and variability are revealed by slow-light imaging because slow-light effects become more enhanced as the plasma velocity becomes more relativistic, and because the plasma acceleration is itself a strong function of the spin.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present the high-resolution X-ray spectrum of the Z-source Cygnus X-2, obtained with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). The observations have enabled a precise characterization of the Fe-K emission lines from the accretion disk corona (ADC) and a possible detection of an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). The ADC component has at least two distinct regions. The Fe-K emission lines are remarkably broad, with a velocity dispersion of $σ_v=2300^{+900}_{-700}$~km~s$^{-1}$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tomoki Wada, Shigeo S. Kimura</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the gamma-ray spectrum in the MeV range arising from electron-positron pair annihilation in fireballs associated with magnetar giant flares (MGFs), motivated by the recent observation of a MeV gamma-ray line feature in a bright gamma-ray burst, GRB~221009A. We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xueying Shao, He Gao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations. This study underscores the value of combined MeV-TeV observations in probing GRB emission mechanisms.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Chakraborty, L. Resmi, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Razzaque, JC. Joshi, S. Majumder, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity theories would manifest as an energy-dependent speed of light, which may potentially distort the observed temporal profile of photons from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances. The dispersion cancellation (DisCan) algorithm offers a powerful methodology for investigating such effects by employing quantities such as Shannon entropy, which reflects the initial temporal characteristics. In this study, we apply the DisCan algorithm to search for LIV effects in the LHAASO observations of GRB 221009A, combining data from both the WCDA and KM2A detectors that collectively span an energy range of $\sim 0.2-13$ TeV.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{aγ} = 1.685 \times 10^{-10},\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \times 10^{-8},\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main targets for the observations of the MAGIC telescopes. As a result of the effort in improving the sensitivity of the instrument and the automatic follow-up strategy, MAGIC detected two GRBs in the very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) range, namely GRB 190114C and GRB 201216C. In GRB 190114C ($z=0.42$), the data collected by MAGIC revealed a new emission component at sub-TeV energies in the afterglow of the GRB. The very rich multi-wavelength dataset, spanning 17 orders of magnitude in energy, allowed to perform a detailed modelling of the broadband emission. The multi-wavelength data could be modelled within a one-zone synchrotron-self Compton scenario with internal $γ-γ$ absorption, where the model parameters are compatible with those found in previous GRB afterglow studies below GeV energies. Similarly, GRB 201216C broadband emission could be explained using the same model, although the amount of simultaneous multi-wavelength data is reduced with respect to GRB 190114C. In particular, GRB 201216C challenged the current MAGIC detection potential, as its redshift was determined to be $z=1.1$, strongly reducing the observed gamma-ray flux but making it the most distant source detected at VHE. These two detections, accompanied by evidence of VHE emission from a few more GRBs, opened up new questions such as the presence of sub-TeV emission in different classes and phases of GRBs. In this contribution we will present the status of the MAGIC GRB follow-up program, with an highlight on its detected GRBs. Moreover we will show the results on the GRBs observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019 with no evidence of VHE emission, in particular for those with simultaneous X-ray observations and redshift $z<2$. We will discuss the implications of these results for GRB physics and the challenges and prospects for future GRB observations with MAGIC.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from explosions at cosmological distances, generating collimated jets. GRB 221009A, exploded on 9 October 2022, has been established as the brightest GRB to date. Its bright and long emission was extensively followed up from radio to gamma rays. LHAASO firmly detected the onset of the afterglow emission at energies up to $\sim$13 TeV within about an hour after the burst, starting just a few minutes after the trigger.

These observations are the first ones performed on GRB 221009A by a Cherenkov telescope, revealing a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$ during the observations performed at 1.3 days after the burst.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is largely limited by the vastness of the signaling parameter space.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ténéman Keita, Renaud Belmont, Thierry Stolarczyk</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF), which could permeate the cosmic voids but was never detected so far, is considered a relic of the early Universe. Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\;\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterise the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\;\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{G}$.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Jieying Liu, Jirong Mao, Shao-Lin Xiong, Yan-Qiu Zhang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">As a characteristic feature of the spectrum, the emission line carries critical information on the underlying physics of the radiation. After extensive efforts in decades, the first high-significant detection of a series of emission lines evolving from 37 MeV to 6 MeV has been detected in the ever-bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A. However, the physical mechanism of the entire evolutionary trend of the lines remains elusive. To provide a self-consistent interpretation, we propose a novel scenario in which the photons of the line undergo a radiation transfer process called down-Comptonization after generation by the electron--positron pair annihilation. By incorporating the gamma-ray burst dynamical evolution, we systematically reproduce the observed evolution of the central energy, width, and flux of the emission line and further impose stringent constraints on the production of high-energy emission lines in general.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Cassandra L. Armstrong, Brendan T. Reed, Tate Plohr, Henrik Rose, Soumi De, Rahul Somasundaram, Ingo Tews</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Multi-messenger observations of neutron stars (NSs) and their mergers have placed strong constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). The EOS, in turn, depends on microscopic nuclear interactions that are described by nuclear Hamiltonians. These Hamiltonians are commonly derived within chiral effective field theory (EFT). Ideally, multi-messenger observations of NSs could be used to directly inform our understanding of EFT interactions, but such a direct inference necessitates millions of model evaluations. This is computationally prohibitive because each evaluation requires us to calculate the EOS from a Hamiltonian by solving the quantum many-body problem with methods such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), which provides very accurate and precise solutions but at a significant computational cost. Additionally, we need to solve the stellar structure equations for each EOS which further slows down each model evaluation by a few seconds. In this work, we combine emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter, built using parametric matrix models, and for the stellar structure equations, built using multilayer perceptron neural networks, with the \texttt{PyCBC} data-analysis framework to enable a direct inference of coupling constants in an EFT Hamiltonian using multi-messenger observations of NSs. We find that astrophysical data can provide informative constraints on two-nucleon couplings despite the high densities probed in NS interiors.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Washington R. de Carvalho, Lech Wiktor Piotrowski</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this work, we investigate the feasibility of event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables only. Although the analysis does not require an explicit reconstruction of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$), the discrimination power still arises from the sensitivity of the radio observables to the longitudinal development of the extensive air shower (EAS). Such radio-based approaches could be particularly relevant for radio-only experiments, such as GRAND. To assess this feasibility, we obtained conservative upper limits for the discrimination accuracy using a supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely a random forest (RF). The input features used were the peak electric fields and the spectral slopes, which have complementary discrimination power, along with the antenna distances to the shower axis. The RF was trained and tested using large event sets generated by the fast radio emission simulation and simplified detector response implemented in the RDSim framework. We obtained discrimination accuracies between 81\% and 96\% over the studied zenith range, even after normalizing each shower by its own electromagnetic energy. Since the analysis includes deliberately conservative choices, such as a large 10\% uncertainty on the reconstructed EM energy, these quoted values should be interpreted as conservative upper limits suitable for a feasibility assessment. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event primary mass discrimination using radio observables is, in principle, feasible.</p>

By extending the traditional Skyrme EDF ansatz with central terms containing up to four gradients, we are able to combine an excellent global description of nuclear ground state properties with a stiff equation of state for pure neutron matter that is consistent with all astronomical observations of neutron stars. More precisely, the new model matches the accuracy of earlier BSkG models but with two parameters less: we achieve root-mean-square deviations of 0.649 MeV for 2457 atomic masses, 0.0267 fm for 810 charge radii, and 0.43 MeV for 45 primary fission barriers of actinide nuclei.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alexandra P. Klipfel, David I. Kaiser</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ashish Kumar, Avinash A. Deshpande, Pankaj Jain</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Various existing models of the Gum Nebula differ significantly in their parameters and suggested origins, which can be independently tested for consistency with data on some key observables of pulsars in the direction of the nebula. Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024. The JWST MIRI/NIRSpec data reveal an extremely red source, showing strong blueshifted absorption from molecular gas (CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$O, SO$_2$) and deep silicate dust features. Modeling the dust continuum confirms continued bolometric fading of the central source to $\log(L/L_\odot)\approx3.88$ ($\approx7-8$% of the progenitor luminosity), surrounded by a dust shell spanning $\approx40-200$ au.

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can form from the near-complete collapse of massive stars, causing them to abruptly disappear. The star M31-2014-DS1 in the Andromeda galaxy was reported to exhibit such a disappearance between 2014 and 2022, with properties consistent with the failed explosion of a $\approx 12 - 13$ M$_\odot$ yellow supergiant leading to the formation of a $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ BH. We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the remnant obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and X-ray observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2024.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yi-Fan Wang, Sizheng Ma, Neev Khera, Huan Yang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of quadratic quasi-normal modes would provide a direct probe into black hole nonlinear perturbations. We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~σ$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Despite the growing number of high-energy neutrinos (TeV-PeV) detected by IceCube, their astrophysical origins remain largely unidentified. Recent observations have linked a few tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the production of high-energy neutrino emission, all of which display dust-reprocessed infrared flares, indicating a dust- and gas-rich environment. By cross-matching the neutrino events and a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies with transient radio flares, we uncover an optically obscured TDE candidate, SDSS J151345.75 $+$ 311125.2, which shows both spatial and temporal coincidence with the sub-PeV neutrino event IC170514B. Using a standard equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral evolution spanning 605 days post mid-infrared discovery, we find a little evolution in the radio-emitting region, with a kinetic energy up to $10^{51}$ erg, depending on the outflow geometry and shock acceleration efficiency assumed. High-resolution European VLBI Network imaging reveals a compact radio emission that is unresolved at a scale of $<$ 2.1 pc, with a brightness temperature of $T_b>5\times10^6$ K, suggesting that the observed late-time radio emission might originate from the interaction between a decelerating outflow and a dense circumnuclear medium. If the association is genuine, the neutrino production is possibly related to the acceleration of protons through pp collisions during the outflow expanding process, implying that the outflow-cloud interaction could provide a physical site with a high-density environment for producing the sub-PeV neutrinos. Such a scenario can be tested with future identifications of radio transients coincident with high-energy neutrinos.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ke Fang, Francis Halzen</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A "knee" in the cosmic-ray spectrum, characterized by a sudden steepening of the spectral shape at $\sim 4$ PeV, may be interpreted either as a global feature of Galactic cosmic rays or as a local signature. In the former scenario, cosmic-ray spectra throughout the Galaxy would be similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood, and the knee would be a common feature of the cosmic-ray sea. In the latter scenario, the PeV cosmic-ray flux varies across the Galactic disk, and the knee is dominantly contributed by a small number of nearby sources. By simulating cosmic-ray propagation in the Galactic magnetic field and interstellar medium, we show that the two scenarios correspond to different regimes of the birth rate of PeV proton accelerators and depend on the presence of powerful nearby sources. By comparison with both cosmic-ray and gamma-ray observations, we find that a local knee would be best explained by sources located at distances of order $\sim1$ kpc and with ages in the range 0.1-1 Myr, with the Cygnus Cocoon being a particularly promising candidate.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Matt Nicholl</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a diverse class of exceptionally bright massive star explosions, which typically exhibit absorption from ionised oxygen in their early spectra. While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Floor van Donkelaar, Lucio Mayer, Pedro R. Capelo, Debora Sijacki, Angela Adamo</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The discovery of gravitationally lensed stellar clusters at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed extremely compact, massive star-forming systems in galaxies at $z > 6$, providing a new window into early cluster formation. In this work, we investigate star cluster formation in the circumgalactic environments of gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses spanning between $\sim$$10^{8}$ - $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z > 7$, using the MassiveBlackPS cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 2 pc resolution. We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at $z \approx 9.6$. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The fate of massive stars above 20M$_{\odot}$ remains uncertain.

The source M31-2014-DS1 experienced an optical outburst in 2014 and has remained faint at visual wavelengths since then. Due to its persistent faintness, it has been proposed as a failed SN candidate. We present new observations of this candidate obtained using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and Chandra. The JWST observations demonstrate that a luminous mid-infrared source persists at the same location a decade after the star faded at visual wavelengths. We model its current spectral energy distribution (SED) as a dust-enshrouded star. No X-ray emission is detected, disfavoring the hypothesis that the late-time luminosity is powered by accretion onto a BH. We find that the remaining source is highly obscured by an asymmetric distribution of circumstellar dust, making it difficult to quantify its physical properties using spherically symmetric radiative transfer codes. The dust geometry requires that the inferred bolometric luminosity is only a lower limit, as a significant fraction of the central source's radiation may escape without being reprocessed by dust. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of failed SN models and consider the potential overlap with signatures expected from a stellar merger, which also seems to provide a plausible explanation of this source.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.</p>

  </h3>
  

  
  <p class="entry-authors collapsible">Peng Yang, Yi-Rong Wang, Kilar Zhang</p>
  

  
  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">M. Reshma, C. S. Stalin, Amit Kumar Mandal, Abhijit Kayal, S. B. Gudennavar, Prajwel Joseph</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Active galactic nuclei are known to exhibit flux variations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Among these, correlations between UV/optical and X-ray flux variations serve as a key diagnostics for understanding the physical connection between the accretion disk and the corona. In this work, we present the results of analysis of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray flux variations in the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 1044. Simultaneous observations in the far-UV band (FUV: 1300$-$1800 Å) and the X-ray band (0.5$-$7 keV) obtained during 31 August $-$ 8 September 2018 with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and the Soft X-ray Telescope onboard \textit{AstroSat} were used for this study. Significant flux variability was detected in both FUV and X-ray bands. The fractional root mean square variability amplitude ($F_{\rm var}$) was found to be 0.036 $\pm$ 0.001 in the FUV band and 0.384 $\pm$ 0.004 in the X-ray band. To explore potential time lag between the two bands, cross-correlation analysis was performed using both the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) and just another vehicle for estimating lags in nuclei (JAVELIN) methods. Results from both approaches are consistent within 2$σ$ uncertainty, indicating that X-ray variations lead the FUV variations, with measured lags of 2.25$\pm$0.05 days (ICCF) and $2.35_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ days (JAVELIN). This is the first detection of a time delay between UV and X-ray variations in Mrk 1044. The observed UV lag supports the disk reprocessing scenario, wherein X-ray emission from the corona irradiates the accretion disk, driving the observed UV variability.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Itamar Giron, Menahem Krief, Nicholas C. Stone, Elad Steinberg</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Jibril Ben Achour, Ileyk El Mellah, Eric Gourgoulhon</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The launch of relativistic jets of plasma on astrophysical to cosmological scales are observed in a variety of astrophysical sources, from active galactic nuclei to X-rays binaries. While these jets can be reproduced by the general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) and particle-in-cells (GRPIC) simulations of the dynamical Kerr magnetosphere, the development of analytic models to describe the physics of the jets has remained limited. A key challenge is to analytically describe the individual trajectories of accelerated charged particles which ultimately build up the jet and emit radiation. In this work, we provide a first simple but fully analytical model of jet launching from the Kerr magnetosphere based on the motion of charged particles. To that end, we use the integrability of electrogeodesic motion in the Kerr monopole magnetosphere to study the ejection of charged particles near the poles. This enables us to derive (i) a criterion for the rotation axis to constitute a stable latitunal equilibrium position, thereby representing an idealized jet, (ii) the expression for the magnetic frame-dragging effect, and (iii) the condition for an asymptotic observer to measure blueshifted particles emanating from the black hole surroundings. Our study reveals that particles can be accelerated only in a specific region whose maximal radius depends on the spin and magnetization of the black hole. Alongside these results, we provide a detailed review of the construction of test magnetospheres from (explicit and hidden) symmetries of the Kerr geometry and the condition for the separability of the electrogeodesic motion in a test magnetosphere, which serves as a basis for the model we study in this work.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Clara Plasse, Alexis Reboul-Salze, Jérome Guilet, Diego Götz, Nicolas Leroy, Raphaël. Raynaud, Matteo Bugli, Tito Dal Canton</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies. Although more likely with upcoming GW interferometers, detecting the spin-down emission of a millisecond magnetar may already be within reach, warranting sustained theoretical and observational efforts given the profound implications for mergers, GRBs, and NS physics of a single detection.</p>

Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst vary aperiodically.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">When a stellar binary encounters a spinning black hole, interesting phenomena might result due to the mutual interaction between the binary spin, orbital angular momentum and the black hole spin. Here we consider such encounters between an intermediate mass spinning black hole and a close identical white dwarf binary system whose center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory. After studying a corresponding three-body problem in the point particle approximation, we perform a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics based numerical simulations of such scenarios. For this, we integrate the geodesic equations for the spinning black hole, while considering the hydrodynamics and the self and mutual gravitational interactions of the stars in a Newtonian approximation, an approach justified by the choice of parameters in the theory. We consider various initial configurations of the binary center of mass leading to equatorial and off-equatorial orbits, as also various initial inclinations between the binary's initial spin angular momentum and its initial orbital angular momentum. We find that the effects of black hole spin manifest clearly in the tidal dynamics of the binary components, while the observables of tidal encounters such as mass fallback rates are strongly dependent on the initial inclination angle. We show that the influence of the black hole spin emerges in distinct ways for different initial configurations of the binary's spin alignment. We establish that within the ambits of the Hills mechanism, in certain cases, the fallback rate may show a three-hump structure, due to interactions between tidal debris of the individual stars.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigated the long-term evolution of the cyclotron line energy, as well as the relationship between cyclotron line energy and luminosity in the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1, based on archival Swift/BAT monitoring from 2005 to 2024 and pulse-to-pulse analysis of nine NuSTAR observations from 2012 to 2024. Our results provide the first confirmation that the long-term decay of the harmonic line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,H}$) in Vela X-1 has ended. We further report the first detection of a transient increase in $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ between 2020 and 2023, which suggests a sudden and significant change in the magnetic field configuration or accretion geometry. In addition, $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ shows slightly lower values at low luminosities and tends to flatten at higher luminosities, in the range of $(0.13\text{--}1.21) \times10^{37} $erg $\rm{s}^{-1}$. The fundamental line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,F}$) exhibits no significant variation with time or luminosity, remaining stable at approximately 25 keV.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigated the long-term evolution of the cyclotron line energy, as well as the relationship between cyclotron line energy and luminosity in the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1, based on archival Swift/BAT monitoring from 2005 to 2024 and pulse-to-pulse analysis of nine NuSTAR observations from 2012 to 2024. Our results provide the first confirmation that the long-term decay of the harmonic line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,H}$) in Vela X-1 has ended. We further report the first detection of a transient increase in $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ between 2020 and 2023, which suggests a sudden and significant change in the magnetic field configuration or accretion geometry. In addition, $E_{\rm cyc,H}$ shows slightly lower values at low luminosities and tends to flatten at higher luminosities, in the range of $(0.13\text{--}1.21) \times10^{37} $erg $\rm{s}^{-1}$. The fundamental line energy ($E_{\rm cyc,F}$) exhibits no significant variation with time or luminosity, remaining stable at approximately 25 keV.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shivam Kumaran, Samir Mandal, Sudip Bhattacharyya</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Extensive astronomical surveys, like those conducted with the {\em Chandra} X-ray Observatory, detect hundreds of thousands of unidentified cosmic sources. Machine learning (ML) methods offer an efficient, probabilistic approach to classify them, which can be useful for making discoveries and conducting deeper studies. In earlier work, we applied the LightGBM (ML model) to classify 277,069 {\em Chandra} point sources into eight categories: active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray emitting stars, young stellar objects (YSO), high-mass X-ray binaries, low-mass X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, cataclysmic variables, and pulsars. In this work, we present the classification table of 54,770 robustly classified sources (over $3σ$ confidence), including 14,066 sources at $>4σ$ significance. To ensure classification reliability and gain a deeper insight, we investigate the multiwavelength feature relationships learned by the LightGBM model, focusing on AGNs, Stars, and YSOs. We employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to quantify the contribution of individual features and their interactions to the predicted classification probabilities.
  Among other things, we find infrared-optical and X-ray decision boundaries for separating AGN/Stars, and infrared-X-ray boundaries for YSOs. These results are crucial for estimating object classes even with limited multiwavelength data. This study represents one of the earliest applications of XAI to large-scale astronomical datasets, demonstrating ML models' potential for uncovering physically meaningful patterns in data in addition to classification. Finally, our publicly available, extensive, and interactive catalogue will be helpful to explore the contributions of features and their combinations in greater detail in the future.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Abell 3571 is a nearby, X-ray bright galaxy cluster located in the Shapley Supercluster. Although it appears morphologically relaxed in X-ray images, multiwavelength observations reveal subtle indications of residual dynamical activity, likely associated with past merger events. Using wide-field ($1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$) data from the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT), we extend measurements of the cluster's properties beyond its $R_{500}$ radius. We detect surface-brightness excesses on both the northern and southern sides, consistent with previous XMM-Newton results. The temperature, pressure, and entropy in the northern excess region are lower than the average values, whereas those on the southern side are slightly higher. However, we find no evidence for cold fronts or shocks. These features can be interpreted as sloshing motions triggered by an off-center minor merger. Our findings suggest that, despite its symmetric appearance, A3571 is still recovering from a minor merger and is currently in a post-merger phase.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Tidal disruption event (TDE) light curves are increasingly used to infer the masses of quiescent supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm{BH}}$), offering a powerful probe of low-mass black hole demographics independent of host-galaxy scaling relations. However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event. We independently model the flares of the three rpTDEs; 2020vdq, 2022dbl, and 2023adr, applying fallback-accretion fits, stream-stream collision scaling relations, luminosity-based empirical relations, and cooling-envelope fits. After accounting for statistical and model-specific systematics, we find that all TDE models generally return self-consistent $M_{\rm{BH}}$ values between flares, and are broadly consistent with host-galaxy $M_{\rm{BH}}$ proxies, recovering $M_{\rm{BH}}$ to within 0.3-0.5 dex. However, the convergence of fallback models towards unphysical stellar masses and impact parameters reveals limitations in the existing fallback model grids. We also show that light curve coverage, particularly in the near-UV, is critical for constraining model parameters. This has direct implications for interpreting the thousands of TDE light curves expected from upcoming surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, where from simulations, we find that $M_{\rm{BH}}$ may be underestimated on average by 0.5 dex without additional follow-up.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a systematic study of the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (L/IMXBs) consisting of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star (NS) and a donor star of mass $1-8\,M_{\odot}$. Using grids of detailed MESA simulations, we show that for donor masses of $2-8\,M_{\odot}$, mass transfer may be dynamically unstable, leading to a common envelope (CE) phase. By adopting CE ejection efficiencies in the range $α_{\rm CE} = 0.3-3.0$, we find that post-CE binaries frequently experience a CE decoupling phase (CEDP), which plays a critical role in determining their final orbital and compositional properties. Systems with initial donor masses $\gtrsim 3.5\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly evolve into NS binaries with carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon white dwarfs (WDs) with masses between $0.5\,M_{\odot}$ and $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. Comparison with the observed population of binary pulsars with a WD companion shows better agreement with higher CE ejection efficiencies ($α_{\rm CE} = 3.0$). Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSs can accrete a sufficient amount of matter ($\gtrsim 0.01\,M_{\odot}$) during the CEDP and subsequent Case BA/BB/BC mass transfer phases to be effectively recycled into millisecond pulsars. We identify two distinct evolutionary channels capable of reproducing the observed characteristics of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1928+1815 with a helium-star companion.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shaokun Xie, Fulai Guo, Ruiyu Zhang, B. Mingo, Fangzheng Shi, Jiang-Tao Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way represent an archetypal case of galactic nucleus feedback, yet their origin remains highly debated. Here we use hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of the "Fermi bubbles" in the nearby Circinus galaxy, a pair of kpc-scaled elliptical bubbles seen in both radio and X-ray observations. We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner "hotspot" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin. Our study thus corroborates the AGN jet-shock model for the origin of both the Circinus bubbles and the Fermi bubbles, and suggests that AGN jet feedback may be a common origin of extended gaseous bubbles in regular disk galaxies, potentially playing an important role in their evolution.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Vera Berger, Erin Kara, Joheen Chakraborty, Megan Masterson, Kevin Burdge</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a five-year X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the optically selected Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT2019teq, which displays extreme variability, including order-of-magnitude changes in flux on minute-to-day timescales, and a rare late-time emergence of hard X-ray emission leading to the longest-lived corona in a known TDE. In one epoch, we detect sub-mHz quasi-periodic oscillations with significance tested via MCMC-based red-noise simulations (p $\leq 0.03$). AT2019teq exhibits a clear spectral evolution from a soft (blackbody-dominated) state to a hard (power-law-dominated) state, with a late-time radio brightening that may be associated with the state transition. We identify similarities between AT2019teq's evolution and X-ray binary soft-to-hard state transitions, albeit at higher luminosity and much faster timescales. We use the presence of both a disk-dominated and a corona-dominated state to apply multiple mass estimators from X-ray spectral and variability properties. These techniques are mutually consistent within $2σ$ and systematically yield a lower black hole mass ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 5.67 \pm 0.09$) than inferred from host galaxy scaling ($\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.14 \pm 0.19$).</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">D. Gagnier, G. Leidi, M. Vetter, R. Andrassy, F. K. Röpke</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Common envelope evolution (CEE) is a crucial phase in binary stellar evolution. Current global three-dimensional simulations lack the resolution to capture the small-scale dynamics around the embedded companion, while local wind-tunnel simulations always approximate the companion's orbital motion as linear rather than as rotation around the center of mass. We investigate how rotation, accretion, and stratification influence small-scale gas dynamics, gravitational drag and lift forces, and the spin-up rate of the companion. We perform three-dimensional local hydrodynamic simulations of a $0.2\, M_\odot$ compact companion plunging into the envelope of a $2\, M_\odot$ red giant in a reference frame rotating at the companion's orbital angular velocity, using the Athena++ code. The presence of stratification generates an inward-directed force, partially opposed by a rotation-induced outward lift force. Both the resulting inward directed force and the drag force, strongly influenced by stratification, would affect the evolution of the binary separation. We propose revised semi-analytical prescriptions for both drag and lift forces. Without accretion and for sufficiently small gravitational softening radii, a quasi-hydrostatic bubble forms around the companion, while accretion prevents its formation and converts kinetic energy into heat that could contribute to the envelope ejection. Drag and lift forces are only marginally affected by accretion. The companion spin-up rate varies non-monotonically in time, first increasing and then decreasing as it plunges deeper into the envelope. These results motivate future magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate how accretion, rotation, and stratification affect magnetic amplification, and how magnetic fields, in turn, influence mass and angular momentum accretion rates, as well as the drag and lift force exerted on the companion.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.</p>

SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.</p>

SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Keigo Fukumura, Alessandro Peca, Roberto Serafinelli, Mauro Dadina</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Motivated by a number of X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that exhibit a potential signature of ultra-fast inflows (UFIs), we consider in this work a scenario that UFIs can be physically identified as weakly-magnetized hydrodynamic accretion flows that is guided and channeled by poloidal magnetic field into low-to-mid latitude above the equatorial disk. In the context of general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) under a weak-field limit in Kerr spacetime, we present a set of preliminary results by numerically calculating the physical property of GRHD flows (e.g. kinematics and density distribution) in an effort to simulate redshifted absorption line spectra. Our model demonstrates that such GRHD accretion off the equatorial plane (i.e. $v \gsim 0.1c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the vicinity of AGN closer than $\sim 100$ \sw radii) can manifest itself as UFIs in the form of redshifted absorption signature assuming the observed characteristics such as column density of $N_H \sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization parameter of $\log (ξ\rm{[erg~cm~s^{-1}])} \sim 3$ as also seen in recent multi-epoch {\it NuSTAR} observations among other data.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">High-density and high-Z crystals are a key element of most space-borne $γ$-ray telescopes operating at GeV energies (such as Fermi-LAT). The lattice structure is usually neglected in the development of a crystalline detector, although its effects on the energy deposit development should be taken into account, since the interactions of a high energy ($\sim$~GeV) photon or e$^\pm$ impinging along the axis of an oriented crystal are different than the ones observed in a fully isotropic medium. Specifically, if the angle between a photon (e$^\pm$) trajectory and the crystal axis is smaller than $\sim$ 0.1$^\circ$, a large enhancement of the pair production (bremsstrahlung) cross-section is observed. Consequently, a photon-induced shower inside an oriented crystal develops within a much more compact region than in an amorphous medium. Moreover, for photon energies above a few GeV and incidence angles up to several degrees, the pair-production cross-section exhibits a pronounced dependence on the angle between the crystal axis and the photon polarization vector. \\ In this work we show that these effects could be exploited to develop a novel class of light-weight pointing space-borne $γ$-ray telescopes, capable of achieving an improved sensitivity and resolution, thanks to a better shower containment in a smaller volume with respect to non-oriented crystalline detectors. We also show that an oriented tracker-converter system could be used to measure the polarization of a $γ$-ray source above few GeV, in a regime that remains unexplorable through any other detection technique. This novel detector concept could open new pathways in the study of the physics of extreme astrophysical environments and potentially improve the detector sensitivity for indirect Dark Matter searches in space.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">I. Stephens, L. Rhodes, A. J. Cooper, S. E. Motta, J. S. Bright</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) is a neutron star X-ray binary in which the neutron star is accreting rapidly from a low mass stellar companion. At radio frequencies, Sco X-1 is highly luminous and has been observed to have jet ejecta moving at mildly relativistic velocities away from a radio core, which corresponds to the binary position. In this Letter, we present new radio observations of Sco X-1 taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Using a fast imaging method, we find that the 10 and 15GHz data show a number of flares. We interpret these flares as the possible launching of fast jets ($βΓ$>2), previously observed in Sco X-1 and called ultra-relativistic flows, and their interaction with slower moving jet ejecta. Using the period between successive flares, we find that it is possible for the fast jets to remain undetected, as a result of the fast jet velocity being sufficiently high to cause the jet emission to be beamed in the direction of the motion and out of our line of sight. Our findings demonstrate that the ultra-relativistic flows could be explained by the presence of fast jets in the Sco X-1 system.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shuo Xiao, Zheng-Huo Jiang, Di Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transients of unknown origin, likely associated with compact astrophysical objects. We report evidence for a damped millisecond quasi-periodic structure in a non-repeat FRB~20190122C. The burst consists of eight closely spaced radio pulses separated by $\sim$1 ms, with pulse amplitudes exhibiting an exponential decay starting from the brightest component. Combined Gaussian fitting and time-series analysis reveal a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $\sim$1 kHz. The observed QPO is consistent with damped magnetospheric oscillations. Assuming an Alfvén wave origin, we estimate a surface magnetic field of $\sim 10^{12}$ G and a characteristic spin period of $\sim$1 s, favoring a low-field magnetar or young neutron star scenario. The absence of frequency drift and the presence of exponential damping disfavor a merger-driven origin.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying, constructing, and validating precise and accurate universal relations for neutron star bulk quantities. A central element is simulation-based inference (SBI), which we adopt to treat uncertainties due to the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS) as intrinsic non-trivial noise. By assembling a large set of bulk properties of non-rotating neutron stars across multiple state-of-the-art EOS models, we are able to systematically explore universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our framework further identifies the most promising parameter combinations, enabling a more focused and traditional construction of explicit universal relations. At the same time, SBI does not rely on explicit relations; instead, it directly provides predictive distributions together with a quantitative measure of systematic uncertainties, which are not captured by conventional approaches. As an example, we report a new universal relation that allows us to obtain the radius as a function of mass, fundamental mode, and one pressure mode. Our analysis shows that SBI can surpass the predictive power of this universal relation while also mitigating systematic errors.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Pulsars are the most numerous class of Galactic gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Young pulsars occasionally experience sudden timing discontinuities called glitches, characterized by rapid changes in rotational parameters, usually followed by a return to regular rotation. PSR J2021+4026 is unique among Fermi-LAT pulsars, exhibiting quasiperiodic switches between two states with varying spin-down rates approximately every 3-4 years, correlated with sudden changes in gamma-ray emission features. This study searched for gamma-ray emission variability in pulsars correlated with glitch occurrence. We introduced a novel approach to analyzing LAT gamma-ray pulsars through systematic examination of variability associated with spin-down rate changes. We tracked rotation and gamma-ray emission changes for seven promising glitches selected based on observed spin-down rate variations. Using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data, we conducted binned likelihood spectral analysis of data windows around selected glitch epochs. We improved best-fit parameter precision by incorporating likelihood weights calculated from diffuse background models, accounting for systematic error contributions. The phase-averaged flux and spectral parameters of analyzed pulsars showed no significant variation across investigated glitches. The 95% upper limits on relative flux change indicate the Vela pulsar flux is unchanging, with a 0.5% upper limit on relative change, making it promising for further searches. The connection between glitch dynamics and gamma-ray emission remains unclear, and PSR J2021+4026 remains unique in its gamma-ray variability properties.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">TON 0599 (z=0.7247) belongs to the few flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) detected in the very high energy (VHE, $E > 100$ GeV) gamma-ray band. Its redshift makes it currently one of the farthest VHE gamma-ray sources. It was detected for the first time with the MAGIC telescopes on 2017 December 15, and observed until December 29. The flux reached a maximum of about 50 per cent of the Crab Nebula flux above 80 GeV on the second night of observation, after which we witnessed a gradual decrease of the flux. The VHE gamma-ray spectrum connects smoothly to the one in the high energy ($E > 100$ MeV) band obtained from simultaneous observations with Fermi-LAT. It features a cut-off at energies around 50 GeV, indicating the location of the gamma-ray emission zone beyond the broad line region. In addition, we were able to follow the spectral evolution during the fading phase of the flare. Multiwavelength analysis based on observations in optical, near-infrared, and radio bands acquired by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration from November to March, as well as observations in X-ray and optical$-$UV bands with instruments on board the Swift satellite, shows strong correlation between different bands. We model the broadband emission with a simple one-zone leptonic model, where the high-energy peak is predominantly produced by external Compton (EC) scattering of photons from the dusty torus.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Rahul Dhurkunde, Ian Harry</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Binary black holes (BBHs) exhibiting spin-induced orbital precession offer unique insight into compact-binary formation channels, cosmology, and tests of general relativity. We conduct a dedicated search for precessing BBHs in Advanced LIGO's third observing run (O3) using the harmonic decomposition method of precessing waveforms. We introduce a novel scheme to reduce the number of filters in a harmonic search. With our new approach, our template bank requires $5\times$ fewer filters compared to another proposed precessing search in the same region. We do not find any new significant events. Our new search method achieves up to $\sim 28\%$ improvement in sensitivity and up to $5\times$ lower computational costs compared to existing precessing search pipelines.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Matteo Pracchia, Om Sharan Salafia</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle τ_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $τ_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Massive short-period binaries involving hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are rare but important to constraining pathways for binary star evolution. Moreover, some of the most promising candidate progenitor systems leading to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) involve sdO/Bs. LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1 has been identified as such a candidate. To explore the nature and evolutionary future of LAMOST J065816.72+094343.1, we complemented archival spectroscopic data with additional time series spectra and high-resolution spectroscopy of the object. After combining these with photometric data, we determined the orbital parameters of the system and the mass of the companion. We solved the orbit of the system by analyzing 68 low- and medium-resolution spectra using state-of-the-art mixed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE model atmospheres. Additionally, we gathered nine high-resolution spectra to determine atmospheric parameters and the projected rotational velocity of the sdOB. The inclination angle of the system was constrained assuming tidal synchronization of the sdOB, which was verified via analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the TESS light curve. We determine LAMOSTJ065816.72+094343.1 to be a binary consisting of a massive $0.82 \pm 0.17 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ sdOB component with a $1.30^{+0.31}_{-0.26} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ unseen companion. Due to the companion's mass being very close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit and high for a white dwarf, it is unclear whether it is a white dwarf or a neutron star. We find the system to be in a close orbit, with a period of $P=0.31955193 \mathrm{d}$ and an inclination angle of $i = 49.6^{+5.2}_{-4.2} \mathrm{deg}$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a detailed timing analysis of the two high-frequency humps observed in the power density spectrum of Swift J1727.8--1613 up to 100 keV, using data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT).

The fractional rms amplitudes of the humps increase with energy, reaching approximately 15\% in the 50-100 keV band. The lag spectrum of the hump is characterized primarily by a soft lag that varies with energy. Our results suggest that the high-frequency humps originate from a corona close to the black hole. Additionally, by applying the relativistic precession model, we constrain the mass of Swift J1727.8--1613 to $2.84 < M / M_{\odot} < 120.01$ and the spin to $0.14 < a < 0.43$ from the full-energy band dataset, using triplets composed of a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation and two high-frequency humps.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Edwin J. Son</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">It is known that there exist theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in general relativity. One is the Buchdahl limit for an object with an arbitrary equation-of-state that turns out to be the limit for an object with uniform density. Another one is the causal limit that is stronger than the Buchdahl limit and is related to the speed of sound inside an object. Similar theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in deformed Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity are found in this \paper. Interestingly, the both curves of the uniform density limit and the sound speed limit meet the horizon curve at the minimum of the horizon, where a black hole becomes extremal, i.e., $M=q$, considering the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum that is an asymptotic flat solution in the HL gravity.</p>

One is the Buchdahl limit for an object with an arbitrary equation-of-state that turns out to be the limit for an object with uniform density. Another one is the causal limit that is stronger than the Buchdahl limit and is related to the speed of sound inside an object. Similar theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in deformed Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity are found in this \paper. Interestingly, the both curves of the uniform density limit and the sound speed limit meet the horizon curve at the minimum of the horizon, where a black hole becomes extremal, i.e., $M=q$, considering the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum that is an asymptotic flat solution in the HL gravity.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Linearly polarized emission is a powerful tracer of magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration in protostellar jets. We present a polarimetric study of the HH objects HH 80 and HH 81 from where non-thermal emission has been confirmed through spectral index measurements at low frequencies. We carried out observations of HH 80 and HH 81 with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in 4-6 GHz. Unlike the inner jet knots, no linear polarization is detected towards the knots HH 80 and HH 81. We place a $3σ$ upper limit of $30~μ$Jy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of $Π_{\max}\approx0.02$ and $0.01$ for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this non-detection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter $χ_\mathrm{s}$ is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80-81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure $σ_{\rm RM}\sim400~\mathrm{rad~m^{-2}}$ is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds. We conclude that reduced acceleration efficiency (when compared to inner knots) and strong depolarization account for the absence of polarized emission towards HH 80 and HH 81.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Aditya Vijaykumar, Amanda M. Farah, Maya Fishbach</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Amanda M. Farah, Aditya Vijaykumar, Maya Fishbach</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $χ\approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Conor M. B. Omand</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A central magnetar engine is commonly invoked to explain energetic supernovae, which should have multiple signals in multiwavelength emission. Photoionization from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can create distinct spectroscopic signals in the nebular phase. Recent models suggest infrared emission, particularly from Ne II, can be prominent at late times. This work examines the cooling power of optical and infrared transitions to determine which lines contribute strongly to cooling and on what timescale. The models show infrared cooling becomes strong at $\sim$ 3 years post-explosion and dominates by 6 years, with [Ne II] 12.8$μ$m being the strongest coolant. The fraction of total cooling in the infrared increases sharply once the PWN luminosity decreases below 10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and this fraction also increases with increasing ejecta mass and decreasing average PWN photon energy. However, the emission from [Ne II] 12.8$μ$m increases with increasing PWN luminosity and increasing ejecta mass. Cooling at 1 year is dominated by optical O and S lines, with infrared Ar, Ni, and Ne lines becoming strong at 3 years. Optical cooling is almost negligible at 6 years, with the supernova cooling almost entirely through mid- and far-infrared transitions. JWST spectroscopy with MIRI should be able to detect these lines out to $z \sim 0.1$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">It has long been thought that black hole accretion flows are driven by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, and there are now many general relativistic global simulations illustrating the dynamics of this process. However, many challenges must be overcome in order to predict observed spectra from luminous systems. Ensuring energy conservation, local thermal balance, and local ionization equilibrium, our post-processing method incorporates all the most relevant radiation mechanisms: relativistic Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and lines and edges for 30 elements and all their ions. Previous work with this method was restricted to black holes of $10 M_\odot$; here, for the first time, we extend it to $10^8 M_\odot$ and present results for two sub-Eddington accretion rates and black hole spin parameter 0.9. The spectral shape predicted for stellar-mass black holes matches the low-hard state for the lower accretion rate and the steep power law state for the higher accretion rate. For high black hole mass, both accretion rates yield power-law continua from $\sim 0.5 - 50$~keV whose X-ray slopes agree well with observations. For intermediate mass black holes, we find a soft X-ray excess created by inverse Compton scattering of low-energy photons produced in the thermal part of the disk; this mechanism may be relevant to the soft X-ray excess commonly seen in massive black holes. Thus, our results show that standard radiation physics applied to GRMHD simulation data can yield spectra reproducing a number of the observed properties of accreting black holes across the mass spectrum.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of non-thermal power-law distribution functions ubiquitously observed in astrophysical/space (e.g., the solar wind) and laboratory kinetic plasmas, is not well understood. Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $κ= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $κ\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $κ\to 1.5$ limit.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Antoni Ramos-Buades, Quentin Henry, Maria Haney</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Black holes (BHs) in microquasars can launch powerful relativistic jets that have the capacity to travel up to several parsecs from the compact object and interact with the interstellar medium. Recently, the detection of large-scale very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission around the black hole transient V4641 Sgr and other BH-jet systems suggested that jets from microquasars may play an important role in the production of galactic cosmic rays. V4641 Sgr is known for its superluminal radio jet discovered in 1999, but no radio counterpart of a large-scale jet has been observed. The goal of this work is to search for a radio counterpart of the extended VHE source. We observed V4641 Sgr with the MeerKAT radio telescope at the L and UHF bands and produced deep maps of the field using high dynamic range techniques. We report the discovery of a large-scale (35 pc), bow-tie-shaped, diffuse, radio structure around V4641 Sgr, with similar angular size to the extended X-ray emission discovered by XRISM. However, it is not spatially coincident with the extended VHE emission. After discussing the association of the structure with V4641 Sgr, we investigate the nature of the emission mechanism. We suggest that the bow-tie structure arose from the long-term action of large-scale jets or disk winds from V4641 Sgr. If the emission mechanism is of synchrotron origin, the radio/X-ray extended structure implies acceleration of electrons up to more than 100 TeV as far as tens of parsecs from the black hole.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Bao-Jun Cai, Bao-An Li, Yu-Gang Ma</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The equation-of-state (EOS) parameter $φ\equiv P/\varepsilon$, defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density, encapsulates the fundamental response of matter under extreme compression. Its value at the center of the most massive neutron star (NS), $\x \equiv φ_{\rm c} = P_{\rm c}/\varepsilon_{\rm c}$, sets a universal upper bound on the maximum denseness attainable by any form of visible matter anywhere in the Universe. Remarkably, owing to the intrinsically nonlinear structure of the EOS in General Relativity (GR), this bound is forced to lie far below the naive Special Relativity (SR) limit of unity. In this work, we refine the theoretical upper bound on $\x$ in a self-consistent manner by incorporating, in addition to the causality constraint from SR, the mass-sphere stability condition associated with the mass evolution pattern in the vicinity of the NS center. This condition is formulated within the intrinsic-and-perturbative analysis of the dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations (IPAD-TOV) framework. The combined constraints yield an improved bound, $\x \lesssim 0.385$, which is slightly above but fully consistent with the previously derived causal-only limit, $\x \lesssim 0.374$. We further derive an improved scaling relation for NS compactness and verify its universality across a broad set of 284 realistic EOSs, including models with first-order phase transitions, exotic degrees of freedom, continuous crossover behavior, and deconfined quark cores. The resulting bound on $\x$ thus provides a new, EOS-independent window into the microphysics of cold superdense matter compressed by strong-field gravity in GR.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yang Liu, Bao Wang, Puxun Wu, Jun-Jie Wei, Xue-Feng Wu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We propose a data-driven approach to reconstruct the all-sky distribution of the dispersion measure contribution from the Galactic halo ($\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$) through a spherical harmonic expansion, enabling an investigation of its possible anisotropies. Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes $|b|>15^\circ$, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$, pointing toward $(l=130^\circ,\, b=+5^\circ)$ with a $1σ$ uncertainty of approximately $28^\circ$. The $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$ value in this direction is $63\pm9~\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, exceeding the all-sky mean by about $2.6σ$. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic ISM models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of $(l=141^\circ,\, b=+51^\circ)$ and a larger 1$σ$ uncertainty of $\sim 44^\circ$. Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Large- or medium-scale cosmic ray anisotropy at TeV energies has not previously been confirmed to vary with time. Transient anisotropy changes have been observed below 150 GeV, especially near the passage of an interplanetary shock and coronal mass ejection containing a magnetic flux rope ejected by a solar storm, which can trigger a geomagnetic storm with practical consequences. In such events, cosmic rays provide remote sensing of the magnetic field properties. Here we report the observation of transient large-scale anisotropy in TeV cosmic ray ions using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We analyze hourly skymaps of the transient cosmic ray intensity excess or deficit, the gradient of which indicates the direction and magnitude of transient large-scale anisotropy across the field of view. We observe enhanced anisotropy above typical hourly fluctuations with $>$5$σ$ significance during some hours of November 4, 2021, in separate data sets for four primary cosmic ray energy ranges of median energy from $E$=0.7 to 3.1 TeV. The gradient varies with energy as $E^γ$, where $γ\approx-0.5$. At a median energy $\leq$1.0 TeV, this gradient corresponds to a dipole anisotropy of at least 1\%, or possibly a weaker anisotropy of higher order. This new type of observation opens the opportunity to study interplanetary magnetic structures using air shower arrays around the world, complementing existing in situ and remote measurements of plasma properties.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Large- or medium-scale cosmic ray anisotropy at TeV energies has not previously been confirmed to vary with time. Transient anisotropy changes have been observed below 150 GeV, especially near the passage of an interplanetary shock and coronal mass ejection containing a magnetic flux rope ejected by a solar storm, which can trigger a geomagnetic storm with practical consequences. In such events, cosmic rays provide remote sensing of the magnetic field properties. Here we report the observation of transient large-scale anisotropy in TeV cosmic ray ions using data from the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). We analyze hourly skymaps of the transient cosmic ray intensity excess or deficit, the gradient of which indicates the direction and magnitude of transient large-scale anisotropy across the field of view. We observe enhanced anisotropy above typical hourly fluctuations with $>$5$σ$ significance during some hours of November 4, 2021, in separate data sets for four primary cosmic ray energy ranges of median energy from $E$=0.7 to 3.1 TeV. The gradient varies with energy as $E^γ$, where $γ\approx-0.5$. At a median energy $\leq$1.0 TeV, this gradient corresponds to a dipole anisotropy of at least 1\%, or possibly a weaker anisotropy of higher order. This new type of observation opens the opportunity to study interplanetary magnetic structures using air shower arrays around the world, complementing existing in situ and remote measurements of plasma properties.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We developed a SpaceWire-based data acquisition (DAQ) system for the FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5 sounding rocket experiments, which aim to observe solar flares with high sensitivity and dynamic range using direct X-ray focusing optics. The FOXSI-4 mission, launched on April 17, 2024, achieved the first direct focusing observation of a GOES M1.6 class solar flare with imaging spectroscopy capabilities in the soft and hard X-ray energy ranges, using a suite of advanced detectors, including two CMOS sensors, four CdTe double-sided strip detectors (CdTe-DSDs), and a Quad-Timepix3 detector. To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare. The same architecture is being adopted for the upcoming FOXSI-5 mission, scheduled for launch in 2026.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ze-Xin Du, Yun-Wei Yu, Aming Chen, Chen-Hui Niu, Jia-Heng Zhang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent observations of FRB 20220529 reveal significant variation and a partial reversal in its rotation measure (RM), suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving magnetized environment, which could be caused by the orbital motion of the magnetar within the binary system. Here we develop the binary model by suggesting that the spin and magnetic axis of the companion star could undergo precession around the orbital axis. It is then investigated how the precession period and the inclination of the magnetic axis, as well as a possible disc wind, can influence the evolution behaviors of the RM and dispersion measure (DM) of FRB emission. As the foremost consequence, the RM variation can be significantly altered on timescales longer than the orbital period, producing super-orbital evolution and complex patterns. Applying this model to FRB 20220529, we find that its RM evolution could be reproduced with a precession period of 182 days and an inclination angle of approximately $19^{\circ}$, while the other binary parameters are fixed at their typical values. Meanwhile, the absence of significant variation of the DM argues against the presence of a dense equatorial disc around the companion star, which would be constrained by future long-term observations.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024abfl, a low-luminosity Type IIP supernova (LLSN) discovered shortly after explosion. The transient reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_V = -14.9$ and exhibited an extended, flat plateau lasting $\sim$125 days. From the late-time bolometric light curve, we estimate a $^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim0.01~M_\odot$, consistent with other LLSNe. Analytical shock-cooling models fail to reproduce the rapid early rise, indicating that circumstellar material (CSM) interaction contributed to the initial emission. The spectroscopic evolution is typical of LLSNe, with relatively narrow metal lines and low expansion velocities ($\lesssim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) that decline slowly over time. We detect a broad ``ledge'' feature around 4600 Åwithin three days of explosion, which we interpret as a blend of high-ionization shock-accelerated CSM lines. Multi-peaked H$α$ profiles develop during the plateau phase, consistent with complex ejecta-CSM interactions. As one of the best-observed examples of LLSNe, SN 2024abfl exhibits a weak explosion and signatures of nearby CSM, offering new insights into progenitor properties, pre-explosion mass loss, and the diversity of LLSNe.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ruocheng Zhai, David Radice, Fabio Magistrelli, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Albino Perego</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Binary neutron star merger (BNSM) ejecta are considered a primary repository of $r$-process nucleosynthesis and a source of the observed heavy-element abundances. We implement composition mixing into ray-by-ray radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of BNSM ejecta, coupled with an online nuclear network (NN). We model mixing via a gradient-based mixing approximation that evolves simultaneously with the hydrodynamics. We find that mixing occurs in regions where the electron fraction changes rapidly. While mixing smooths composition gradients in transition regions, it has a negligible impact on the heavy-element yields. This is because the primary $r$-process site (the equatorial ejecta) is initially homogeneous in free neutrons, leaving no strong gradients for mixing to act upon. In each angular ray, the abundances of the most produced elements are robust under mixing, while the less abundant ones are more affected. The total global abundances change only slightly from mixing, since each angular ray contributes its most abundant elements. Furthermore, the predicted kilonova light curves show only minor reddening, with differences below the detectability of state-of-the-art telescopes. In general, we do not observe significant effects from mixing in the time span of the $r$-process. Consequently, mixing only leads to minor variations in abundances and light curves in ray-by-ray simulations.</p>
