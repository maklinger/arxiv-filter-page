</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Wen-Long Zhang, Jun-Jie Wei</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a statistical analysis of the extreme brightness of the fast radio burst FRB 20250316A, a luminous, apparently non-repeating event detected by CHIME/FRB. Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\sim$ 600 years ($1σ$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($ξ> 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\sim50$-year return period in $1σ$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($ξ< 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys. Our results underscore the existence of rare, highly luminous events that may probe the upper limits or distinct sub-populations of the FRB luminosity distribution.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Zhi-Qiu Huang, Om Sharan Salafia, Lara Nava, Annalisa Celotti, Giancarlo Ghirlanda</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations are currently among the most advanced tools to investigate particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $ε_{\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Liang Li, Yu Wang, Jin-Jun Geng, Yong-Feng Huang, Rong-Gen Cai</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a systematic pulse-by-pulse analysis of 22 long-duration GRBs observed by \emph{Swift}, each exhibiting a well-separated precursor before the main burst. We compare duration, spectral hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag between these components. Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows. Despite temporal differences, both episodes are consistent with a single collapsar origin, providing no evidence for dual-progenitor events.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Fan Dai, Ranjan Maitra</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Characterising and distinguishing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has interested astronomers for many decades. While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Zhao-Feng Wu, Sofía Guevara-Montoya, Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios, Daniel Grošelj, Lorenzo Sironi</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Celsa Pardo-Araujo, Nanda Rea, Michele Ronchi, Vanessa Graber</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($<$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($<$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.</p>

Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($<$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($<$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Nissim Fraija, Antonio Galvá, Boris Betancourt Kamenetskaia, Maria G Dainotti</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB~250704B/EP250704a, identified as a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), exhibited prolonged X-ray emission following the prompt phase and, in optical and infrared (IR) bands, an unusual one-day plateau succeeded by a rapid decline. This sGRB was observed by multiple satellites and ground-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum. This study presents temporal and spectral analyses from radio to gamma-ray frequencies, spanning several observation periods beginning after the trigger and continuing for nearly 2 days. The results of the temporal and spectral analyses of the prompt episode, the extended X-ray component, and the afterglow phase are consistent with a millisecond magnetar undergoing accretion. The long-lasting X-ray emission is attributed to the internal energy dissipation of the magnetar spin-down power, governed by the magnetization parameter; the extended optical/IR plateau to synchrotron afterglow emission with energy injection; and the steep decay to changes in microphysical parameters during the post-jet break phase. The X-ray observations are consistent with the superposition of spin-down luminosity and synchrotron afterglow scenario. These findings suggest that the compact-object remnant is most likely a long-lived magnetar.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Piotr Płonka, Agnieszka Janiuk</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $γ$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $γ$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours.

Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3<Γ<0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">B. Thakore, M. Regis, M. Negro, S. Camera, D. Gruen, N. Fornengo, A. Roodman</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Our understanding of the $γ$-ray sky has greatly advanced, yet studying the unresolved $γ$-ray background (UGRB) can unveil the nature of the faintest $γ$-ray source populations in the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations between the UGRB and tracers of large-scale cosmic structure allow us to infer which sources contribute the most to this emission. In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $γ$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved γ-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $γ$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Our understanding of the $γ$-ray sky has greatly advanced, yet studying the unresolved $γ$-ray background (UGRB) can unveil the nature of the faintest $γ$-ray source populations in the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations between the UGRB and tracers of large-scale cosmic structure allow us to infer which sources contribute the most to this emission. In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $γ$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved γ-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $γ$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Emma Dreas, Andrea Pavan, Riccardo Ciolfi, Annalisa Celotti</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This study extends the 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a jet emerging from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger presented in Pavan et al. (2023), in which an incipient jet was manually injected into the realistic environment imported from a previous general-relativistic MHD simulation of a merging BNS system. The jet evolution is followed up to almost 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Our results reveal that the jet faces challenges in penetrating the dense surroundings, leading to a barely successful outflow that exhibits structural asymmetries and low Lorentz factors. By the end of the extended simulation, 98% of the jet energy is converted to kinetic form and its angular structure is stabilized. The physical quantities inferred thus provide reliable inputs for afterglow emission calculations. This work demonstrates a method for simulating jets in 3D up to nearly ballistic regimes that is general and ready to be applied to any jet in a BNS merger context.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Run-Chao Chen, Jun Yang, Yi-Han Iris Yin, Bin-Bin Zhang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Coherent oscillations at kilohertz frequencies have recently been detected in a small number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), suggesting quasi-periodic dynamics in their central engines. A prominent example is GRB~230307A, which exhibited a brief, highly coherent, energy-dependent periodic signal interpreted as the possible spin signature of a nascent millisecond magnetar formed after a compact binary merger. Motivated by these developments, we conducted a comprehensive search for similar signals, accounting for both temporal and spectral dependencies, in 532 short GRBs with time-tagged event data recorded by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) onboard the \textit{Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory}. Within this sample, we identify a single statistically significant case: GRB~960616 (BATSE trigger~5502), in which the $\sim$30~ms main emission episode is coherently modulated at 1100~Hz, with the strongest modulation above 320~keV and a fractional amplitude of $\sim$47\%. Assuming the presence of a coherent periodic modulation, we use data-driven Monte Carlo simulations to place an upper limit of $\sim$8\% on the fraction of the total radiated energy that can be modulated by the QPO. This event, exhibiting a periodicity at $\sim$0.91~ms, further supports the possibility that millisecond periodicities can arise during GRBs in merger-driven scenarios.</p>

The measurements were performed using angular power spectra estimated with the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method. No significant cross-correlation is found.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has produced the largest database of all-sky observations in gamma rays with its continuous data with high time and energy resolutions. These data contain a wealth of unidentified transient events that did not trigger the detectors for various reasons. We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients.

In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast ($<$1$\,$hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of $g\sim22.2$ AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g<22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti.

Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows.

Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year.

The work considers observational prospects in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios such as around highly luminous compact objects (e.g., pulsars, gamma-ray bursts) interacting with tenuous interstellar or intergalactic plasmas, where conditions favor Comptondominated wakefield acceleration.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Emma Dreas, Om Sharan Salafia, Andrea Pavan, Riccardo Ciolfi, Annalisa Celotti</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Nilanjana Bagchi Aurpa, Abha Dev Habib, Nisha Rani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful probe of the cosmic expansion history far beyond the redshift range accessible to Type Ia supernovae. However, the calibration of GRB luminosity correlations is hindered by the circularity problem, which arises from assuming a fiducial cosmological model during calibration. In this work, we perform a model independent calibration of GRB luminosity relations using observational Hubble parameter H(z) data from the A220 and J220 compilations, thereby avoiding explicit cosmological assumptions. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets. While the Amati Parameters obtained from GRBs caibrated from the ANN and BNN results are consistent with previous low redshifts calibrations using model-independent methods, the BNN approach provides a more robust framework.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning, Omer Bromberg, Tsvi Piran</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present the distribution of the intrinsic duration of gamma-ray bursts' prompt emission. This expands upon the analysis of Bromberg et al., 2012 and Bromberg et al. 2013 who showed evidence for collapsar progenitors based on the presence of a plateau in the distribution of $T_{90}$, the duration over which 90 % of the prompt emission is observed for any given detector. We confirm the presence of this plateau in the distribution of duration corrected for cosmological time dilation (what we call intrinsic duration, $T_{int}$), but shifted to smaller timescales by a factor of $1/(1+z_{\rm av}) \sim 1/3$, where $z_{\rm av}$ is the average GRB redshift. More significantly, we show this plateau is only present in the sample of GRBs with redshifts greater than $(1+z) \sim 2$, and does not appear in the duration distribution of lower redshift GRBs. This result aligns with suggestions that the low redshift population of GRBs has a significant contribution from non-collapsar progenitors (while the high redshift sample is dominated by collapsars). We also show the difference in this distribution between spectrally hard and soft GRBs, confirming that a plateau is only present for the soft subset of GRBs. However, when we separate the soft GRBs into low and high redshift subsets, we find that only the high redshift soft GRBs show evidence of a plateau, while the low-redshift soft GRBs do not. This suggests there exists a significant subset of spectrally soft non-collapsar progenitors at low redshift. Finally, we use the end time of the plateau to constrain the GRB progenitor density profile and radius, and show the maximum size of a collapsar is a few tenths of a solar radius.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Dhruv K. Desai, Luciano Combi, Daniel M. Siegel, Brian D. Metzger</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xue-Zhao Chang, HouJun Lü, Zhao-Wei Du, Xing Yang, En-Wei Liang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The jet compositions of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are very important to understand the energy dissipation and radiation mechanisms, but it remains an open question in GRB physics. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis to search for 88 bright GRBs that include a total of 129 pulses observed by Fermi/GBM with redshift measured, and extract the spectra of each pulse with Band function (Band), cutoff power-law (CPL), blackbody (BB), non-dissipative photospheric (NDP), Band+BB, as well as CPL+BB. We find that 80 pulses, 35 pulses, and 14 pulses present purely non-thermal, hybrid, and thermal spectra, respectively. By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($σ$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $σ>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $σ$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $σ$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.</p>

By focusing on those 80 pulses with purely non-thermal spectra, one can estimate the lower limits of magnetization factor ($σ$) via suppressing the pseudo-thermal component. It is found that 30 pulses in 21 GRBs are the lower limit of $σ>5$ at the photosphere by adopting $R_{0}=10^{10}$ cm. It suggests that at least the outflow of those GRB jets with high $σ$ is dominated by Poynting-flux. On the other hand, we also perform the light curve fitting with a fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED) model for 15 bright GRBs with a high magnetization factor in our sample, and find that a correlation between pulse width ($w$) and energy of 13 GRBs really exists in their energy-resolved light curves. It is also a piece of independent evidence for those GRBs with a high value $σ$ to support the origin of the Poynting flux outflow.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Matteo Pracchia, Om Sharan Salafia</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle τ_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $τ_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Haojia Xia, Shichuan Chen, Hong-Bo Li, Enping Zhou, Ren-Xin Xu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of the central engine powering short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remains a key open question in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Plateau features are frequently observed in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), yet their physical origins remain under debate. In this work, we compile a sample of 124 GRBs with known redshifts and simultaneous X-ray and optical afterglow observations. We categorize them into four subsets based on the existence of plateaus and the bands in which they appear. Namely, Dataset 1: plateaus are detected simultaneously in both X-ray and optical bands (75 bursts); Dataset 2: plateaus are only in X-rays (15 bursts); Dataset 3: plateaus appear only in the optical (17 bursts); Dataset 4: no plateaus in either band (17 bursts). We employ these datasets to test the applicability of the energy-injection model by examining whether the temporal decay index $α$ and the spectral index $β$ of GRB afterglows simultaneously satisfy the closure relations in X-ray and optical bands. We find that 47 bursts of Dataset 1 simultaneously obey the closure relations in both bands under the conditions of the electron spectral index $p>2$ and the injection parameter $q\in (0, 0.5)$, and 69 of the dataset for $p>1$ and $q\in (0, 0.8)$, providing a strong support for the energy-injection interpretation. However, for Datasets 2 and 3, although $α$ and $β$ of the plateaus mostly satisfy the closure relations, those in the other band show significant deviations, which implies that bursts with a single-band plateau are inconsistent with the interpretation of energy injection. Furthermore, we also compare the isotropic X-ray energy of plateaus with the rotational energy budget of millisecond magnetars.</p>

The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xue-Zhao Chang, HouJun Lü, Jia-Ming Chen, En-Wei Liang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xueying Shao, He Gao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Liang Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Over the past two decades, the \textit{Swift} and \textit{Fermi} missions have identified a rare class of ``double-trigger'' gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that produce two independent trigger events. These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($τ_{\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.</p>

We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most potent probes of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), offering direct constraints on the quantum gravity energy scale ($E_{\rm QG}$) based on observations of energy-dependent time lags. Individual GRBs with well-defined positive-to-negative lag transitions have been used to set lower limits on $E_{\rm QG}$, but they suffer from uncertainties of spectral-lag measurements and systematics due to theoretical modeling of each burst. Here, we combine observations of 32 GRBs with positive-to-negative lag transitions to derive a statistically robust constraint on $E_{\rm QG}$ through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We find that the dominant systematic uncertainty in LIV constraints arises from the intrinsic lag modeling. Accounting for this uncertainty with cubic spline interpolation, we derive robust limits of $E_{\rm QG,1} \ge 4.37 \times 10^{16}$~GeV for linear LIV and $E_{\rm QG,2} \ge 3.02 \times 10^{8}$~GeV for quadratic LIV. We find that the probability for LIV, i.e., $E_{\rm QG,1}$ being below the Planck scale, is estimated to be around 90\%, which we conclude as no significant evidence for LIV signatures in current GRB spectral lag observations. Our hierarchical approach provides a rigorous statistical framework for future LIV searches and can be extended to incorporate multi-messenger observations.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tatsuya Matsumoto</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($β_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $β_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $β_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe.

This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Jonathan Granot, Hagai B. Perets, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Brendan O'Connor</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB$\;$250702B is the longest GRB recorded so far, with multiple gamma-ray emission episodes spread over a duration exceeding $25\;$ks and a weaker soft X-ray pre-peak $\sim1\;$day gradually rising emission. It is offset from its host galaxy center by $\sim5.7\;$kpc, and displays a long-lived afterglow emission in radio to X-ray. Its true nature is unclear, with the two leading candidate classes of objects being a peculiar type of ultra-long GRB and a tidal disruption event (TDE) by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). Here, we consider the latter, mTDE origin. We model the afterglow data, finding a stratified external density profile $\propto r^{-k}$ with $k=1.60\pm0.17$, consistent with Bondi accretion of the interstellar medium (of initial number density $n_{\rm ISM}=n_0\;{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and sound speed $c_s=c_{s,6}10^6\;{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$) for which $n(r)\approx n_{\rm ISM}(r/R_{\rm B})^{-3/2}$ within the Bondi radius $R_{\rm B}$. Moreover, we use the implied density normalization to infer the IMBH mass within this model, finding $M_\bullet\approx\left(6.55^{+3.51}_{-2.29}\right)\times10^3\,n_0^{-2/3}\,c_{s,6}^{2}(1+\mathcal{M}^2)\;M_\odot$ where $\mathcal{M}\equiv v_{\rm BH}/c_s$ is the IMBH's Mach number relative to the ISM. Together with an upper limit on $M_\bullet<\frac{c^3}{G}\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z} \lesssim5\times10^4\,M_\odot$ from the source-frame minimum variability time $t_{\rm MV,src}\!=\!\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z}\!\approx\!0.5\;$s this implies $v_{\rm BH}\lesssim 28\,n_0^{1/3}\;{\rm km\;s^{-1}}$. We show that a mTDE of a main-sequence star (but not of a white dwarf) can explain the duration and energetics of GRB$\;$250702B. The gradual rise to the peak may be caused by gradual circularization and accretion disk buildup, leading to an increase in the jet's power and Lorentz factor.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the Universe and serve as powerful probes of the early cosmos. However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification.

Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up.

Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Kanako Nakama, Kazumi Kashiyama, Nobuhiro Shimizu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Both observational and theoretical studies indicate that the central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is intrinsically time-variable, implying jet inhomogeneity. A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$σ$ region of the galaxy mass model.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The observational link between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) is well established.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Stefano Profumo, Kally Wen</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $γ$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a "plateau" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a "plateau" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xiao-Hong Zhao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</p>

However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario.

Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Chakraborty, L. Resmi, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Amit Kumar, Sayan Chakrabarti, Santabrata Das</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Sandeep Kumar Acharya</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass.

In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">High-energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, X-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts are powered by mechanisms that convert gravitational or rotational energy into radiation, jets, and relativistic outflows.

Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">On 9 October 2022, the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever recorded (GRB 221009A) was detected. Its remarkably bright emission, partially due to its close distance to Earth ($z\sim0.15$), makes this GRB a unique event. The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The rate of observed gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) indicates the existence of more than one short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) similar to GW/sGRB 170817A within the total gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) recorded by satellite detectors such as BATSE, Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT). We investigated sGRBs in the Fermi-GBM dataset based on their MeV-GeV $γ$-ray emission features, to identify sGRBs similar to sGRB 170817A. Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Nissim Fraija, Boris Betancourt-Kamenetskaia, Antonio Galván, Maria Dainotti</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations. The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$. A shallower external medium density profile ($k<2$) departs from the canonical approximation of a steady wind ($k=2$) from the progenitor star and may indicate a non-steady wind or a transition to an interstellar medium.</p>

Multi-wavelength data and multi-standards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly.

Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have the similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetars with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equations of state. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Wen-Yuan Yu, Hou-Jun Lü, Xiao Tian, Liang-Jun Chen, En-Wei Liang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 250114A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) which triggered the Swift/BAT with a spectroscopic high-redshift at $z = 4.732$. The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds.

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 250114A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) which triggered the Swift/BAT with a spectroscopic high-redshift at $z = 4.732$. The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds. While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $γ$-ray detectability threshold.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Pragyan Pratim Bordoloi, Shubh Mittal, Shabnam Iyyani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is commonly attributed to non-thermal radiation processes operating in the optically thin regions of a relativistic outflow. Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $Γ\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\%$-$20\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $δ\sim 1.8$. The derived Comptonisation parameters indicate moderate $y$ values ($\sim 1$-$3$), optical depths $τ\sim 0.2$-$0.6$, and dissipation radii just above the photosphere, consistent with mildly relativistic ($γ_{\min} \sim 1.2$-$2.6$), photon-dominated, low-magnetic-field dissipation environments. Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">C. R. Das</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Strange quark matter (SQM) is considered a possible true ground state of QCD at high densities. This idea motivates research on exotic compact objects and certain cosmic-ray phenomena. For instance, the remnant HESS J1731-347 contains a low-mass neutron star, about $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ $M_\odot$ and $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km in radius, making it a strong candidate for a strange quark star. Other events, such as GW170817 and GRB 250702B, provide conditions that may favor the formation of strangelets. Strangelets are stable clusters of SQM, potentially created during the phase transition between the 2SC and CFL color-superconducting states. These clusters could generate monochromatic $γ$-ray lines in very-high-energy spectra through self-annihilation. This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models. Data from H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT, MAGIC-II, and CTA were used to set limits on spectral features and possible fluxes. Detecting narrow $γ$-ray lines will require improved instrument sensitivity. By integrating evidence from multimessenger astrophysics and dense QCD simulations, this study investigates the equations of state for compact stars and explores the potential cosmological influence of SQM.</p>

Based on observational data of SVOM/GRM and Fermi/GBM, we perform a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis for individual pulse in the prompt emission of this burst, and novel characteristics are revealed. Firstly, opposite evolutions of spectral lag are found in the first and third pulse of this burst. Second, the large negative lag of the first pulse is an outlier in short GRB sample, especially when the pulse duration is considered. Spectral analysis shows that the negative lag of the first pulse is caused by the evolution of spectrum index, and is irrelevant to Epeak, which is inconsistent with the previous study. The intrinsic mechanism is probably attributed to electron cooling in the decaying magnetic field, which leads to the continuous hardening of the spectrum index and results in negative lag. Furthermore, spectral analysis also shows that the third pulse is more likely to be described by a quasi-thermal spectrum, indicating the existence of photospheric emission. It is difficult to explain how the synchrotron radiation appears before photospheric emission in a single GRB and some assumptions are discussed.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We study the effects of emission geometry on the capability to constrain black hole parameters from measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow of a Reissner-Nordström black hole. We investigate the capability to constrain mass, charge, observer inclination, and emission co-latitude from images of black hole accretion flows that would arise from thick and thin accretion disks. We confirm previous studies that have shown that independent radii measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow can constrain black hole parameters if the viewing inclination is known, but find that it is only possible if the true emission geometry is also assumed.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32π^2}θ_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The radio galaxy M87 is well known for its jet, which features a series of bright knots observable from radio to X-ray wavelengths. The most famous of these, HST-1, exhibits superluminal motion, and our analysis of {\it Chandra} data \citep{Thimmappa24} reveals a correlation between the X-ray flux of HST-1 and its separation from the core. This correlation likely arises from moving shocks in the jet, allowing measurement of the internal structure of HST-1 in the X-ray band. To follow up on these results, we use observations from the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys HRC/WFC/SBC channel and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)'s UVIS to analyze the image and flux variability of HST-1. Our analysis includes 245 ACS and 120 WFC3 observations from 2002-2022, with a total exposure time of $\sim345$ ks. We study the brightness profile of the optical jet and measure the relative separation between the core and HST-1 for comparison to the X-ray. We find that the X-ray and the UV/optical emission could arise from physically distinct regions. The measured proper motion of the knot HST-1 is 1.04$\pm$0.04 c from 2002-2005 and around 2.1$\pm$0.05 c from 2005-2022.

  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16370v1">Hot, Retrograde Tilted MADs: Misaligned, Precessing, and Shaped by Electromagnetic Torques</a>
</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Sajal Gupta, Jason Dexter</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Tilted accretion disks in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state may be present in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei such as Sgr A* and M87. We have carried out 3D global GRMHD simulations to study the evolution of these accretion flows as a function of black hole spin and misalignment angle. Prograde MADs align with the spin through a two-stage process: an initial rapid alignment phase that operates on the magnetic flux saturation timescale, followed by a slower, spin-independent phase. In contrast, retrograde MADs remain persistently misaligned regardless of the black hole spin, displaying solid-body precession at rates four times higher than weakly magnetized flows at the same spin magnitude. By deriving torque equations in ideal GRMHD and evaluating them in a frame aligned with instantaneous disk orientation, we demonstrate that electromagnetic (EM) torques always act to align the disk with the BH spin, but are countered by opposing hydrodynamic fluxes in retrograde flows. We further develop a preliminary empirical model to explain the cause of two-stage prograde alignment and discuss the possibility of alignment in the retrograde MAD. Strongly magnetized, retrograde, misaligned accretion disks provide a candidate scenario for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black hole X-ray binaries.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tanmay Kumar Poddar, Sourov Roy, Pratick Sarkar</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Compact astrophysical systems such as neutron stars and black holes provide powerful laboratories for testing feebly coupled dark photons (DPs). We investigate light DPs kinetically mixed with the visible photon that need not be the dark matter, focusing on resonant photon-DP oscillations in magnetized, modeled plasma environments. We show that realistic non-monotonic plasma density profiles generically enhance resonant conversion relative to monotonic models, leading to substantially stronger constraints on the photon-DP kinetic mixing parameter ($ε$). Using spectral data from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87*, extending to the LOFAR band, we derive a bound $ε\simeq 7\times10^{-6}$ at the DP mass $m_{A'} \simeq 5\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation distance $3r_{\rm ph}$, where $r_{\rm ph}$ denotes the photon sphere radius. From the Crab pulsar-wind Nebula, we obtain an even stronger constraint, $ε\simeq 8\times10^{-7}$ at $m_{A'} \simeq 4\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation baselines of order $10^{3}\,\mathrm{km}$, surpassing existing astrophysical limits in realistic plasma backgrounds. While laboratory and cosmological bounds remain slightly stronger at comparable masses, observation of compact objects with larger surface magnetic fields and measurements of photon spectra at lower frequencies would enhance the limits on the photon-DP coupling by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Zachary Gelles, Andrew Chael, Eliot Quataert</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We analyze the polarization of optically thin, stationary, axisymmetric black hole jets at scales of order the light cylinder radius. Our work generalizes the face-on results of Gelles et al. (2025) to arbitrary viewing inclination. Due to a combination of geometry and relativistic aberration, the polarization of the jet is not left-right symmetric, and the degree of asymmetry can shed light on both the viewing angle and the plasma bulk Lorentz factor. We show that there is always a radius in the jet at which the polarization transitions from azimuthal to radial; this radius is different along the spine and limb of the jet. We propose metrics that can be used to constrain the black hole spin, inclination angle, and plasma Lorentz factor from these polarimetric signatures, and we discuss the impact of limb-brightening on these measurements. We anticipate that these polarimetric signatures can be studied with current or forthcoming data in M87, NGC 315, NGC 4261, Centaurus A, Cygnus A, and other systems. Observations of the polarization of the base of the counter-jet in higher inclination sources would provide a particularly promising probe of black hole spin.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits.

Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Faizuddin Ahmed, Ahmad Al-Badawi, İzzet Sakallı</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $α$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shan-Shan Zhao, Ru-Sen Lu, Lei Liu, Zhiqiang Shen</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The 1.3 mm ground-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), is limited by the Earth's diameter and can image the supermassive black hole (SMBH) shadows of only M87* and Sgr A*. Extending the array with an assumed lunar-based telescope could achieve $\sim 0.85\ μ$as angular resolution at 230 GHz, enabling black hole shadow detection for a larger SMBH sample. The concept is motivated by space VLBI missions and lunar exploration, including the ongoing Lunar Orbit VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) aboard QueQiao-2 (Chang'E-7) and the planned International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). We assess shadow detectability for 31 SMBH with predicted large angular sizes, exploring different telescope location and antenna size. Assuming a telescope at the lunar antipode, we simulate the Moon-Earth (u,v) coverage and show that source geometry relative to the Moon's orbit determines whether the primary indicator of shadow, first visibility null, can be sampled. Using a geometric ring model, we identify six high-priority targets: M104, NGC 524, PGC 049940, NGC 5077, NGC 5252, and NGC 1052. Shadows of M104, NGC 5077, and NGC 1052 are detectable with a 5 m lunar-based telescope; PGC 049940 requires 20 m; NGC 524 and NGC 5252 require 100 m. Photon ring detection for Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1600, and M31 is possible if space telescopes fill the baseline coverage gaps and sensitivity requirements are met. These results provide a clear scientific and technical motivation for lunar-based telescopes in future black hole shadow studies.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Roman N. Burridge, Geoffrey C. Bower</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of black hole mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond SgrA* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Himanshu Verma, Priyanka Sarmah, Joseph Silk, Kingman Cheung</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The resolution of photon rings of Sgr~A$^*$ and M87 is the next milestone of upcoming EHT-like interferometries. We extend the formalism developed in our previous work~\cite{Verma:2023hes} to constrain primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter using microlensing-induced distortions of black hole shadows. Building upon the theoretical framework for microlensing of photon rings, we apply this methodology to both Sgr A* and M87, considering multiple PBH populations: (i) PBH dark matter spikes around central supermassive black holes, (ii) NFW halo contributions in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, and (iii) foreground Milky Way PBH dark matter affecting M87* observations. The microlensing signal manifests as a time-dependent asymmetry and deformation of the photon ring, providing the most sensitive observable for lensing effects. We assess the detectability of these signatures with future EHT-like interferometers. Our analysis reveals that M87* provides the strongest constraints on PBH dark matter. We show that the absence of photon-ring asymmetries in observations with angular resolution of order $0.1\,μ{\rm as}$ can constrain PBHs in the mass range $10^{-5}\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, with maximal sensitivity near $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{3}\,M_\odot$, for PBH dark matter fractions as small as $f_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-2}$.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe.

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT).

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alejandro Cruz-Osorio, Claudio Meringolo, Christian M. Fromm, Yosuke Mizuno, Sergio Servidio, Antonios Nathanail, Ziri Younsi, Luciano Rezzolla</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">M. Baran Ökten</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$. The pipeline enables either a detection of the strong-field parallel-transport phase induced by frame dragging or informative upper limits.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Wen-Long Zhang, Jun-Jie Wei</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a statistical analysis of the extreme brightness of the fast radio burst FRB 20250316A, a luminous, apparently non-repeating event detected by CHIME/FRB. Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\sim$ 600 years ($1σ$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($ξ> 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\sim50$-year return period in $1σ$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($ξ< 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Zhao-Feng Wu, Sofía Guevara-Montoya, Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios, Daniel Grošelj, Lorenzo Sironi</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae.

Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tomoki Wada, Shigeo S. Kimura</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the gamma-ray spectrum in the MeV range arising from electron-positron pair annihilation in fireballs associated with magnetar giant flares (MGFs), motivated by the recent observation of a MeV gamma-ray line feature in a bright gamma-ray burst, GRB~221009A. We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xueying Shao, He Gao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations. This study underscores the value of combined MeV-TeV observations in probing GRB emission mechanisms.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Chakraborty, L. Resmi, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">On 9 October 2022, the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever recorded (GRB 221009A) was detected. Its remarkably bright emission, partially due to its close distance to Earth ($z\sim0.15$), makes this GRB a unique event. The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign.</p>

The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Razzaque, JC. Joshi, S. Majumder, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{aγ} = 1.685 \times 10^{-10},\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \times 10^{-8},\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main targets for the observations of the MAGIC telescopes. As a result of the effort in improving the sensitivity of the instrument and the automatic follow-up strategy, MAGIC detected two GRBs in the very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) range, namely GRB 190114C and GRB 201216C. In GRB 190114C ($z=0.42$), the data collected by MAGIC revealed a new emission component at sub-TeV energies in the afterglow of the GRB. The very rich multi-wavelength dataset, spanning 17 orders of magnitude in energy, allowed to perform a detailed modelling of the broadband emission. The multi-wavelength data could be modelled within a one-zone synchrotron-self Compton scenario with internal $γ-γ$ absorption, where the model parameters are compatible with those found in previous GRB afterglow studies below GeV energies. Similarly, GRB 201216C broadband emission could be explained using the same model, although the amount of simultaneous multi-wavelength data is reduced with respect to GRB 190114C. In particular, GRB 201216C challenged the current MAGIC detection potential, as its redshift was determined to be $z=1.1$, strongly reducing the observed gamma-ray flux but making it the most distant source detected at VHE. These two detections, accompanied by evidence of VHE emission from a few more GRBs, opened up new questions such as the presence of sub-TeV emission in different classes and phases of GRBs. In this contribution we will present the status of the MAGIC GRB follow-up program, with an highlight on its detected GRBs.

  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22138v1">Optimal cross-correlation technique to search for strongly lensed gravitational waves</a>
</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Anirban Kopty, Sanjit Mitra, Anupreeta More</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates.

  <p class="entry-authors collapsible">Anirban Kopty, Sanjit Mitra, Anupreeta More</p>
  

  
  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We study the effects of emission geometry on the capability to constrain black hole parameters from measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow of a Reissner-Nordström black hole. We investigate the capability to constrain mass, charge, observer inclination, and emission co-latitude from images of black hole accretion flows that would arise from thick and thin accretion disks. We confirm previous studies that have shown that independent radii measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow can constrain black hole parameters if the viewing inclination is known, but find that it is only possible if the true emission geometry is also assumed.

For each spectrum, we perform a spectral decomposition to isolate the broad H$β$ emission. We measure the luminosity, FWHM, equivalent width, centroid, and Pearson skewness coefficient of broad H$β$ and provide derived physical properties such as the single-epoch black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity. For each pair of spectra in the sample, we calculate the change in radial velocity of the centroid of broad H$β$ emission ($Δv_{rad}$) as well as other derived properties related to broad H$β$ shape variability. We use forward-modeling methods to estimate the uncertainty in our measurements and discuss an improved method for estimating the uncertainty in $Δv_{rad}$ in the case where a spectral decomposition is used to isolate the broad H$β$ emission. We find that $Δv_{rad}$ is not normally distributed and that the shape of the distribution depends on the interval between observations.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Wen-Long Zhang, Jun-Jie Wei</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a statistical analysis of the extreme brightness of the fast radio burst FRB 20250316A, a luminous, apparently non-repeating event detected by CHIME/FRB. Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\sim$ 600 years ($1σ$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fréchet type ($ξ> 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fréchet-type distribution with a $\sim50$-year return period in $1σ$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($ξ< 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations are currently among the most advanced tools to investigate particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. Still, they come with limitations imposed by finite computing power, whose impact is not straightforward to evaluate a priori. Observational features are hence required as verification. energy electrons accelerated at external shocks, provides a testbed for such predictions. Current numerical studies suggest that in GRB afterglows the maximum synchrotron photon energy, which corresponds to the limit of electron acceleration, may fall within the $\sim$ 0.1--10 keV X-ray energy band at late times, $t\gtrsim 10^6 - 10^7$ s. To test this prediction, we analyzed the X-ray spectra of six GRBs with \emph{Swift}/XRT detections beyond $10^7$ s: our analysis reveals no clear evidence of a spectral cutoff. Using a model that accounts for the effect of the finite opening angle of the shock on the observed maximum synchrotron photon energy, we show that these observations are incompatible with PIC simulation predictions, unless one or more physical afterglow parameters attain values at odds with those typically inferred from afterglow modeling (small radiative efficiency, low ambient density, large equipartition fraction $ε_{\rm B}$ of the magnetic field). These findings challenge existing numerical simulation results and imply a more efficient acceleration of electrons to high-energies than seen in PIC simulations, with important implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Extended gamma-ray sources surrounding middle-aged pulsars, primarily observed at teraelectronvolt energies, have been interpreted as pulsar halos, where relativistic $e^\pm$ diffuse into the interstellar medium and produce inverse-Compton (IC) emission. HESS J1813-126, associated with the energetic, radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J1813-1246, has been suggested as a candidate pulsar halo, though its nature remains uncertain. We interpreted the high-energy emission of PSR J1813-1246 using the synchro-curvature (SC) radiation model and tested whether the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1813-126 can be explained as a pulsar halo powered by PSR J1813-1246. We explain the X-ray and gamma-ray SEDs of the pulsar using the SC framework. We further computed the transport and losses of $e^\pm$ injected by the pulsar through time-dependent diffusion-loss equations, exploring various common pulsar halo transport models. The resulting IC emission was compared with \textit{Fermi}-LAT, H.E.S.S., HAWC, and LHAASO data. We present predictions for the surface brightness profiles (SBPs) and the aperture-dependent emission for the different transport models, providing key diagnostics for assessing the observability of HESS J1813-126 with current and future instruments. The SC framework successfully reproduces the emission of PSR J1813-1246. The SED of HESS J1813-126 can be consistently reproduced within different pulsar halo frameworks, albeit with distinct predictions across different transport models. The corresponding SBP predictions and aperture-dependent emission offer testable signatures for future imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, which will be crucial for discriminating between the transport models.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Samuzal Barua, Hengxiao Guo, Minfeng Gu, Wenwen Zuo</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent reverberation delay measurements have moved beyond the 10 keV X-ray range, providing evidence for the Compton hump (a.k.a. reflection hump) in the lag spectra. We report the relativistic reverberation of the reflection hump in the bright Seyfert\,1 galaxy IC\,4329A based on a long {\it NuSTAR} observation. We find a delayed response of the 20--30 keV X-ray band, with a lag time of $\sim1825$ s at frequencies $0.5-1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $\sim195$ s as the frequencies increase to $(1.5-10)\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Including IC\,4329A, so far five sources have been explored for reflection hump reverberation. We perform reverberation modelling of the 3--50 keV lag-energy spectra using the general relativistic transfer function code, which provides independent timing-based measurements of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}=1.37_{-0.36}^{+0.33}\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and the coronal height $h=2.45_{-2.36}^{+1.92}~R_{\rm g}$ (with uncertainties at 90\% confidence).

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent reverberation delay measurements have moved beyond the 10 keV X-ray range, providing evidence for the Compton hump (a.k.a. reflection hump) in the lag spectra. We report the relativistic reverberation of the reflection hump in the bright Seyfert\,1 galaxy IC\,4329A based on a long {\it NuSTAR} observation. We find a delayed response of the 20--30 keV X-ray band, with a lag time of $\sim1825$ s at frequencies $0.5-1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $\sim195$ s as the frequencies increase to $(1.5-10)\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Including IC\,4329A, so far five sources have been explored for reflection hump reverberation. We perform reverberation modelling of the 3--50 keV lag-energy spectra using the general relativistic transfer function code, which provides independent timing-based measurements of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}=1.37_{-0.36}^{+0.33}\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and the coronal height $h=2.45_{-2.36}^{+1.92}~R_{\rm g}$ (with uncertainties at 90\% confidence). Within the uncertainties, the measured mass is found to be consistent with the previous finding. Furthermore, we undertake reflection spectroscopy to account for the hump feature and the associated relativistic effect using the time-averaged flux spectrum. Further sampling of the {\it NuSTAR} data (with a bin width of 0.2/0.4 keV below and above 10 keV) that reshapes the spectral resolution allows us to constrain the coronal temperature at $50.26_{-4.03}^{+5.58}$ keV -- consistent with the previous result from the combined {\it Suzaku} and {\it NuSTAR} data.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Chengchao Yuan, Ruo-Yu Liu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This work investigates the origin of the TeV emission detected by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) from NGC 4278, a galaxy hosting a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN). Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $γ$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\rm L,0}(ΔT_{\rm TeV}/T) \sim 10^{-5}~\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Masato Shirasaki, Ryuichi Takahashi, Ken Osato, Kunihito Ioka</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We conduct a cross-correlation analysis between large-scale structures traced by the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy catalog and the cosmic dispersion measures of 133 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs). The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 < R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] < 1$. Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \sim 0.01\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ should be below $\sim 10\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We develop a machine learning model based on a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to reconstruct and generate neutron star (NS) equations of state (EOS). The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\%)$ for $(M_{\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ataru Tanikawa, Akito Tajitsu, Satoshi Honda, Hiroyuki Maehara, Bun'ei Sato, Kento Masuda, Masashi Omiya, Hideyuki Izumiura</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We have discovered a compact hierarchical triple main-sequence star system, which is cataloged as Gaia DR3 1010268155897156864 or TIC 21502513. Hereafter, we call it ``G1010''. G1010 consists of a primary (the most massive) star and inner binary that orbit each other. The primary star is a $0.85_{-0.03}^{+0.03}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star, and the inner binary components are $0.63_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ and $0.61_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ MS stars. The outer and inner orbital periods are $277.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ and $\sim 18.26$ days, respectively. G1010 is categorized as a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and its orbital solution indicates that G1010 possibly accompanies a massive compact object, such as a neutron star or massive white dwarf. In order to confirm the presence of a massive compact object, we have performed several-times low signal-to-ratio (SNR) and one-time high SNR spectroscopic observations, and determined the outer orbital parameters. Moreover, we have deeply analyzed the high SNR spectroscopic data, and found that G1010 accompanies not a massive compact object, but an inner binary. We have investigated G1010's light curve in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and concluded that the inner binary is actually an eclipsing binary, not included in TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. We have obtained the inner orbital parameters from the TESS light curve. G1010 is similar to compact hierarchical triple star systems previously discovered by eclipse timing variation analysis. Our discovery has shown that such triple star systems can be discovered by combination of low- and high-SNR spectroscopic observations with the help of Gaia DR3 and the upcoming Gaia DR4/DR5.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of the radio emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated. Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alberto Revilla Peña, Ruxandra Bondarescu, Andrew P. Lundgren, Jordi Miralda-Escudé</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Dylan L. Jow, Delon Shen</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Compact radio sources such as pulsars and FRBs undergo scintillation in the interstellar medium (ISM) when scattered images interfere at the observer. ``Scintillometry'' refers to the range of techniques to extract astrometric information -- such as the angular positions of the images and distances to the scattering screen and source -- from scintillation observations. Pulsar scintillometry has proven to be a powerful technique, revealing rich and unexpected scattering phenomenology in the ISM and also shedding light on the emission physics of pulsars. FRB scintillometry stands to be a similarly powerful probe of FRB emission, as well as structure on tiny scales in ionized media beyond our galaxy, such as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). However, nascent FRB scintillation studies are far from the sophisticated lensing geometry reconstructions that have been performed for scintillating pulsars. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for scintillometry, demonstrating that the full astrometric content of scintillation observations is contained within a single underlying observable: the instantaneous spatial wavefield. We relate the instantaneous spatial wavefield to more familiar concepts from the pulsar scintillometry literature, such as the dynamic spectrum. Using this framework, we discuss prospects and limitations for FRB scintillometry, towards the goal of full astrometric reconstructions of FRB lensing geometries. We show how key degeneracies in two-screen scattering measurements can be ameliorated.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Willy Fischler, Tom Banks</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32π^2}θ_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Arihant Tiwari, Rachana, Vivek M, Suvendu Rakshit</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present an analysis of 22,656 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 ($0.1\leq z\leq 0.9$), identifying a sample of spectroscopically anomalous sources. These anomalies were detected via the spectroscopic quasar anomaly detection (SQuAD) algorithm, which employed principal component analysis and hierarchical k-means clustering. Various physical diagnostic analysis were performed such as the color excess ($E_{(B-V)}$) calculations, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color analysis, probing O III, equivalent width as an inclination indicator, the BPT diagram and eigenvector 1 diagram. We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\lambda3345$, Ne V $\lambda3426$, Ne III $\lambda3869$ etc). We conclude that the differentiating factor between red and blue NLSy1s is not dust obscuration or orientation effect, but intrinsic distinction in AGN activity.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Binary neutron star mergers are expected to generate intense magnetic fields that power relativistic and non-relativistic outflows and shape their multimessenger signatures. These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been proposed as candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos. Successful and choked jets, as well as the accretion disk, corona, wind, and outflow regions in a TDE have been examined and shown to produce TeV - PeV neutrinos. In this work, we use the IceCube 12.5 year high energy starting events (HESE) dataset and perform a maximum likelihood analysis to investigate the spatial and temporal correlations between HESE dataset and a selected sample of 89 TDEs. Our results indicate that the currently observed data do not show any significant correlation and hence is consistent with the background only hypothesis. Using this result, we place constraints on the fraction of TDEs harboring intrinsic jets ($f_{\rm jet}$) and the corresponding isotropic-equivalent cosmic ray (CR) energy ($\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR}$). We note that even with limited statistics, we can constrain the parameter space as $\mathcal{E}_{\rm CR} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{53}$ erg for $f_{\rm jet} \gtrsim 0.6$ at more than 90% C.L. Finally, we discuss the theoretical implications of our results and the limits on the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux from TDEs. With more observational data in the electromagnetic band for TDEs and neutrino observations from IceCube and KM3NeT, our analysis can be used to place stringent constraints on physical parameters associated with TDEs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A significant fraction of galaxy clusters show central cooling times of less than 1 Gyr and associated central cluster entropies below $30\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$. We provide a straight forward explanation for these low central entropies in cool core systems and how this is related to accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Assuming a time-averaged equilibrium between active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet heating of the radiatively cooling intracluster medium (ICM) as well as Bondi accretion, we derive an equilibrium entropy that scales with the SMBH and cluster mass as $K\propto M_\bullet^{4/3}M_{500\mathrm{c}}^{-1}$. At fixed cluster mass, overly massive SMBHs would raise the central entropy above the cool core threshold, thus implying a novel way of limiting SMBH masses in cool core clusters. We find a limiting mass of $1.4\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in a cool core cluster of mass $10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We carry out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster with AGN jets and find that they reproduce the predictions of our analytic model, once corrections for elevated jet entropies are applied in calculating X-ray emissivity-weighted cluster entropies. Our findings have significant implications for modelling galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations: a combination of overmassive SMBHs and high heating efficiencies preclude the formation of cool core clusters.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Gabriel Sasseville, Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo, Daryl Haggard, Alexandre Adam, Hadrien Paugnat, Gunther Witzel</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*.</p>

We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This paper discusses the broad science case for obtaining milliarcsecond to microarcsecond astronomical imaging resolution in the soft to medium-energy X-ray band (~0.5 to ~8 keV). Astronomy across much of the electromagnetic spectrum has been fundamentally transformed with a rapid increase in ground-based and space-based capabilities to examine celestial objects on small scales that relate directly to their relevant physical processes. X-ray imaging capabilities, however, have fallen far behind observations at longer wavelengths. As such, without decisive advances in X-ray imaging, we will be unable to uncover key phenomena on the smallest astrophysical scales, leaving entire classes of high-energy discoveries beyond our reach. Here we describe several science goals for which high quality X-ray imaging is crucial and the status of some current technologies or mission concepts that would be required for these advances. In particular, we discuss the Accretion Explorer, a mission architecture under current study for a dispersed aperture X-ray interferometer.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Paige Ramsden, Sean L. McGee, Matt Nicholl</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Restricted by event horizon suppression, tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a unique window into otherwise hidden supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the lower end of the mass spectrum, allowing the connection between star formation and SMBH mass to be explored across a broad stellar mass range. We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \lesssim M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Smaranika Banerjee, Hamid Hamidani, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Masaomi Tanaka</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the signature of the jet-ejecta interaction in early kilonova (t < 1day) using detailed atomic opacities developed in Banerjee et al. (2020, 2024), appropriate for early times (t~1hour after merger). We explore jets with different powers and opening angles. We find that the presence of the jet shifts the spectral peak to longer wavelengths, with the strongest effect near the polar viewing angle. This occurs because the jet creates a thin, low-density outer layer ahead of the bulk ejecta. The opacity of this layer can be as high as kappa ~200 cm2/g, causing photons to escape from cooler, faster-moving outer layer rather than from the hot inner ejecta. The bolometric light curves likewise exhibit a clear imprint of the jet-ejecta interaction, showing suppressed early-time luminosity near polar viewing angles compared to the equatorial one, as the photosphere resides in this thin layer where radioactive heating is lower than in the bulk ejecta. These signatures are also evident in multi-color light curves, particularly in the ultraviolet and u-bands. In the Swift-UVW2 band at t~= 0.15 days for a source at 100 Mpc, the ultraviolet luminosities can reach ~ 19.5 mag if no jet is present, while the presence of the jet can make it fainter by ~ 2.5 mag. The strongest observational signature occurs in the UVEX-NUV, Swift-UVW2, and UVM2 bands, which remains detectable out to viewing angles of ~ 60 deg for t <=1 days. Rapid follow-up with future ultraviolet facilities, such as ULTRASAT and UVEX, will provide powerful probes of jet-ejecta interaction through early-time kilonova observations.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Magnetic fields play a central role in black hole astrophysics, powering relativistic jets and other energetic phenomena. While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.</p>

X-ray spectra of SNRs, which trace shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium, are crucial diagnostics of progenitor systems and explosion physics. Thanks to recent advances in spectroscopy with XRISM, high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy enables 3-D diagnostics, including line-of-sight velocities. In this study, we perform 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs from six Type Ia explosion models: two each of pure deflagration, delayed detonation, and double detonation.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Huan Yang, Bing Liu, Houdun Zeng, Xiaoyuan Huang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a detailed analysis of $γ$-ray emission from the middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0$-$1.7) using approximately 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. Spatially, a new extended $γ$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$α$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified.

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a detailed analysis of $γ$-ray emission from the middle-aged supernova remnant (SNR) S147 (G180.0$-$1.7) using approximately 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data. Spatially, a new extended $γ$-ray component distinct from the emission associated with the H$α$ filaments of the SNR shell is identified. This new component exhibits a strong spatial correlation with dense molecular clouds (MCs) identified in CO emission at Local Standard of Rest velocities of $0$-$5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Sasha Levina, Floor Broekgaarden, Lieke van Son, Emanuele Berti, Amedeo Romagnolo, Ruediger Pakmor, Ana Lam</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\,M_\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Pavan Vynatheya, Luc Dessart, Taeho Ryu, Rüdiger Pakmor</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In a dense star cluster core, a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a white dwarf (WD) can occur if the WD passes within the tidal radius of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes -- the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days. We recover the typical rise times and peak luminosities of SNe Ia, but with an extremely strong viewing-angle dependence of both light curves and spectra. At nebular times, isolated strong emission lines like [Ca ii] λλ 7291, 7323 may appear both displaced and skewed by many $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$ -- such extreme offsets are harder to identify at earlier times due to optical depth effects and line overlap.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tsvi Piran, Julian Krolik, Taeho Ryu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a physically-grounded population model for optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) that combines first-principles hydrodynamic simulations of stellar disruption with statistical inference of the underlying stellar and black hole populations. The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\sim 30\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars. We predict a large population of difficult to detect low luminosity TDEs, implying that the true volumetric TDE rate may exceed that inferred from present samples by up to an order of magnitude.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Akos Bogdan, Gerrit Schellenberger, Qiong Li, Christopher J. Conselice</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure. Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \times10^{44} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \times 10^{13} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure. Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \times10^{44} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \times 10^{13} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Elizabeth Hillenkamp, Raphael Baer-Way, Poonam Chandra, Arkaprabha Sarangi, Roger Chevalier, Nayana A. J., Annika Deutsch, Keiichi Maeda, Nathan Smith</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Supernovae characterized by enduring narrow optical hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) are believed to result primarily from the core-collapse of massive stars undergoing sustained interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). While the properties of SN IIn progenitors have relatively few direct constraints, the ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction provides unique information about late-stage stellar mass-loss preceding core-collapse. We present late-time X-ray and radio observations of four $\geq$3000 day-old SNe IIn: SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s. The radio and X-ray emission from KISS15s indicate a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim4\times 10^{-3}~{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$450 years pre-supernova -- 2 orders of magnitude below earlier optical estimates (which probed the mass-loss immediately preceding the supernova). We find hints of a spectral inversion in the radio SED of KISS15s; a possible signature of a secondary shock due to a binary system or the emergence of a pulsar wind. For SN 2013L, we obtain a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim2 \times 10^{-3}~\rm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$400 years pre-explosion based on the X-ray detection. For SN 2014ab and SN 2015da, we find a upper limits on the mass-loss rates of $\rm{\dot M<2\times10^{-3}~M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ explosion at $\sim$ 250 and 300 years pre-explosion, respectively. All four objects display mass-loss rates lower than estimates from earlier optical analyses by at least 1-3 orders of magnitude, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process over the last centuries pre-explosion. Our analysis reveals how X-ray and radio observations can elucidate progenitor evolution when these objects have faded at optical wavelengths.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shin'ichiro Ando, Martin Moro, Youyou Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' -- compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $ρ\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Elissaios Andronopoulos, Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a unified description of dense matter and neutron-star structure based on simple but physically motivated models. Starting from the thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases, we construct an equation of state for cold, catalyzed matter by combining relativistic fermion statistics with the liquid drop model of nuclear binding. The internal stratification of matter in the outer crust is described by $β$-equilibrium, neutron drip and a gradual transition to supranuclear matter. Short-range repulsive interactions inspired by Quantum Hadrodynamics are incorporated at high densities in order to ensure stability and causality. The resulting equation of state is used as input to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, yielding self-consistent neutron-star models. We compute macroscopic stellar properties including the mass-radius relation, compactness and surface redshift that can be compared with recent observational data. Despite the simplicity of the underlying microphysics, the model produces neutron-star masses and radii compatible with current observational constraints from X-ray timing and gravitational-wave measurements. This work demonstrates that physically transparent models can already capture the essential features of neutron-star structure and provide valuable insight into the connection between dense-matter physics and astrophysical observables while they can also be used as easy to handle models to test the impact of more complicated phenomena and variations in neutron stars.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">An T. Le</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific "sweet spot," success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($η_{\rm cum} \approx 19\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of accretion disc winds remains disputed to date. High inclination, dipping, neutron star Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) provide an excellent testbed to study the launching mechanism of such winds due to being persistently accreting and showing a nearly ubiquitous presence of highly-ionised plasmas. We aim to establish or rule out the presence of a wind in the high inclination LMXB 4U 1624-49, for which a highly ionised plasma has been repeatedly observed in X-ray spectra by Chandra and XMM-Newton, and a thermal-radiative pressure wind is expected. We leverage the exquisite spectral resolution of XRISM to perform phase-resolved spectroscopy of the full binary orbit to characterise the highly ionised plasma at all phases except during absorption dips. An outflow is clearly detected via phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source with XRISM/Resolve. Based on analysis of the radial velocity curve we determine an average velocity of ~200-320 km/s and a column density above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The line profiles are generally narrow, spanning from ~50 to ~100 km/s, depending on the orbital phase, pointing to a low velocity sheer or turbulence of the highly ionised outflow and a potential increase of turbulence as the absorption dip is approached, likely due to turbulent mixing.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The simplest approach to include a mass into the electromagnetic vector potential is to modify the Einstein-Maxwell action to the Einstein-Proca form. There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_γ<10^{-48}\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $μ\leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 < \mathrm{Q} < 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry. Since the Proca parameter is coupled to the black hole mass, the effect of the Proca charge becomes more pronounced for supermassive black holes compared to stellar-mass objects.

Rubin Observatory within four days after merger, and by DECam within two days after merger if located at a distance of 200 Mpc.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Chen-Wei Du, Yu-Feng Zhou</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the possibility of constraining primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{g}$ through Galactic diffuse synchrotron emissions. Due to Hawking radiation, these types of PBHs are expected to be stable sources of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and positrons with energies below $\mathcal{O}(10\,\mathrm{MeV})$. In many CR propagation models with diffusive re-acceleration characterized by a significant Alfvén velocity $V_a\sim \mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{km/s}$, the energies of the evaporated electrons/positrons can be further enhanced to $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\mathrm{MeV}$ through their scattering with the Galactic random magnetic fields. Consequently, the observation of Galactic synchrotron emissions at frequencies above $\sim 20\,\mathrm{MHz}$ can provide useful constraints on the abundance of PBHs. Using the AMS-02 and Voyager-1 data on the boron-to-carbon nuclei flux ratio, we confirm that a significant Alfvén velocity $V_a \sim 20\,\mathrm{km/s}$ is favored in several benchmark diffusive re-acceleration models. We show that, in this scenario, the observed low-frequency synchrotron emissions (from 22 MHz to 1.4 GHz) can provide stringent constraints on PBH abundance. The obtained conservative constraints are stronger than those derived from the Voyager-1 all-electron (electron plus positron) data by more than one order of magnitude for $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$, and also stronger than our previous constraints derived from the AMS-02 positron data for $M_\mathrm{PBH}\gtrsim 2\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Motivated by recent experimental refinements of stellar reaction rates, we establish a non-perturbative Green's function formalism based on the exact solution of the Dyson equation for sub-barrier proton-nucleus resonant scattering.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present FIRES, a polarised shot-noise framework that models fast radio burst (FRB) dynamic spectra as the incoherent superposition of Gaussian microshots. Applied to the CRAFT bursts FRB 20191001A and FRB 20240318A, FIRES reproduces key spectro-polarimetric behaviours: scattering suppresses position-angle (PA) variability on the trailing edge, while the leading edge preferentially retains intrinsic structure when sufficient signal-to-noise is present. We quantify this behaviour using the PA variance ratio $\mathcal{R}_ψ$ and explore the joint plane of measured linear polarisation fraction $Π_L$ versus PA variance to constrain the allowed parameter space of microshot number $N$, intrinsic PA dispersion $σ_ψ$, and intrinsic linear fraction $Π_{L,0}$ at fixed signal-to-noise. For FRB~20191001A, the data are consistent with an extended region spanning $σ_ψ\sim 10^\circ$--$30^\circ$ and $N \sim 5$--$1000$, reflecting degeneracies between intrinsic PA structure, microshot superposition, scattering, finite sampling, and noise. FRB~20240318A occupies a more restricted region, favouring fewer microshots ($N \lesssim 20$) and larger intrinsic PA dispersion ($σ_ψ\sim 15$--$23^\circ$), depending on $Π_{L,0}$, consistent with its observed PA variability. By combining an emission-mechanism-independent framework with minimal assumptions and observational constraints, FIRES provides direct, quantitative constraints on the space of viable FRB microphysical models and demonstrates that microshot superposition offers a natural explanation for the diverse polarimetric behaviours observed in FRBs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics.

Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission.

This inferred nearby high-density CSM extending out to $3\pm 1 \times10^{15}$ cm is similar to that seen in the other two X-ray detected CaSTs, and its presence suggests that either intensive mass-loss or some polluting mechanism may be a common feature of this subclass. Our work also expands upon recent studies on the optical properties of SN 2025coe and explores our current understanding of different progenitor systems that could possibly produce CaSTs.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alexis Marret, Frederico Fiuza</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast, counter-streaming plasma outflows drive magnetic field amplification, plasma heating, and particle acceleration in numerous astrophysical environments, from supernova remnant shocks to active galactic nuclei jets. Understanding how, in the absence of Coulomb collisions, energy is redistributed between the different plasma species remains a fundamental open question. We use 3D fully-kinetic simulations to investigate energy partition in weakly magnetized counter-propagating plasmas. Our results reveal a complex interplay between different processes, where at early times the Weibel instability drives a first stage of magnetic field amplification and at late times the kinking of current filaments drives a second amplification stage via a dynamo-type mechanism. Electrons are heated primarily during the latter phase through magnetic pumping. By the time the flows thermalize, we observe that the final temperature ratio $T_e/T_i$ and energy partition depend on the ion-to-electron mass ratio. For electron-proton flows, the electron thermal energy only reaches up to a few percent of the initial ion kinetic energy.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tousif Islam, Tejaswi Venumadhav, Digvijay Wadekar</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Using a combination of \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} imaging, a runaway supermassive black hole (RBH-1) was recently identified with an inferred velocity of $954^{+110}_{-126}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, likely ejected from a compact star-forming galaxy (denoted as GX) at $z \approx 0.96$. Assuming the runaway black hole was the outcome of the gravitational-wave-driven merger of two black holes, we use its measured runaway velocity together with gravitational-wave recoil predictions from numerical relativity and black hole perturbation theory to constrain the mass ratio and spin configuration of the progenitor SMBHs that overcame the final-parsec problem and merged $\sim 70$~Myr ago. We find that the progenitor binary must have been precessing, with a mass ratio $m_1/m_2\lesssim 6$, and that the more massive SMBH must have possessed a high spin (dimensionless spin magnitude $\sim 0.75$) in order to generate a recoil of this magnitude. This has important astrophysical implications as similar SMBH mergers can be an interesting source population for the upcoming LISA mission with signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim$ 1000. Furthermore, the progenitor SMBH properties imply that GX was likely formed through a major, gas-rich (``wet'') merger between two galaxies of comparable mass, with a mass ratio $\lesssim 4$.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present multiwavelength observations and analysis of six luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) discovered in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey data.

  With the exception of AT2024aehp (ZTF24abygbss), these transients exhibit peaks in their $10\,$GHz radio light curves at $t_{\text{rest}} \approx 50-100$ d, with peak radio luminosities ranging from $10^{38}-10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Modeling the radio emission as synchrotron radiation indicates a fast ($v=0.1-0.3c$) shock in a dense ($n_e\approx10^{3}-10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) medium. The X-ray emission varies by $\approx2$ orders of magnitude in luminosity ($10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) at $t_{\text{rest}}\sim20 $d.
  Analysis of the host-galaxy photometry and spectroscopy for each transient shows that they are predominantly nonnuclear (a few kpc offset) with star-forming host galaxies of stellar masses $10^{9}-10^{11} ,M_\odot$.
  Unlike all other LFBOTs to date, AT2024aehp exhibited a luminous ($M<-19 $mag) plateau in the optical light curve; spectra during this plateau phase showed a featureless blue continuum. The $6-15$ GHz radio emission of AT2024aehp brightened by over an order of magnitude from $t_{\text{rest}} \approx70 $d to $t_{\mathrm{rest}} \approx130 $d.
  The mostly consistent radio behavior between optically selected LFBOTs implies a similar circumburst medium, leading us to prefer a progenitor scenario in which mass is lost in a consistent way shortly prior to the terminal event, such as a massive star merging with a compact object.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Taya Govreen-Segal, Ehud Nakar, Kenta Hotokezaka, Christopher M Irwin, Eliot Quataert</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a quantitative model for the luminous fast blue optical transient AT2018cow in which a shock propagating through an aspherical circumstellar medium (CSM) produces the X-ray and UV/optical/NIR emission. X-rays are emitted from hot post-shock electrons, and soft X-ray photons are reprocessed into optical/UV emission in the cool downstream. This naturally explains two previously puzzling features: (i) the coordinated evolution of the optical and soft X-ray after day 20, (ii) the hard X-ray hump above 10 keV that disappears around day 15 as the Thomson optical depth transitions from $τ_T \gg1$ to $τ_T \sim 1$.
  Our model is over-constrained, and it quantitatively reproduces the bolometric luminosity evolution, soft X-ray spectrum, and time-dependent soft/hard X-ray and soft X-ray/optical luminosity ratios. It also explains additional puzzles: X-ray fluctuations with $\sim4-10$ day timescales arise from a global radiative shock instability, while the NIR excess and the apparent receding blackbody radius result from reprocessed X-rays in matter far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The radio is naturally explained as originating from a shock driven by the same ejecta in the more dilute CSM. The light curve steepening after $\sim 40$ days likely indicates the shock reaches the edge of the dense CSM at $\sim {\rm few} \times 10^{15}$ cm. We infer explosion energy $\sim 1-5 \times 10^{50}$ erg, carried by an ejecta at $\sim 0.1c$ and a mass of $0.01-0.05 M_\odot$, in a dense asymmetric CSM with $\sim 0.3 M_\odot$, embedded in a more dilute CSM.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Every astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave (GWB) is limited by the amount of rest mass available to be converted into gravitational radiation. Here we derive a population-agnostic scaling law that places an absolute energetic ceiling on stochastic backgrounds across the entire GW frequency spectrum, from nanoHertz to kilohertz. We apply this framework to bound the backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries, intermediate-mass black hole captures by supermassive black holes in AGN disks, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, binary neutron stars, Population III remnants, and stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that the energetic ceiling for supermassive black hole binaries is $A \leq 1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ at a reference frequency of $1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This astrophysical GWB ceiling is within $1σ$ with the GWB amplitude reported by NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, implying that the current observed signal is consistent with being powered by a population of ultramassive black holes ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$). Finally, we demonstrate that the total astrophysical background from all channels combined cannot exceed $Ω_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-7}$.</p>

We apply this framework to bound the backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries, intermediate-mass black hole captures by supermassive black holes in AGN disks, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, binary neutron stars, Population III remnants, and stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that the energetic ceiling for supermassive black hole binaries is $A \leq 1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ at a reference frequency of $1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This astrophysical GWB ceiling is within $1σ$ with the GWB amplitude reported by NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, implying that the current observed signal is consistent with being powered by a population of ultramassive black holes ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$). Finally, we demonstrate that the total astrophysical background from all channels combined cannot exceed $Ω_{\rm gw} \sim 10^{-7}$.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">MohammadReza Torkamani, Robert Reischke, Michael Kovač, Andrina Nicola, Jozef Bucko, Alexandre Refregier, Sambit K. Giri, Aurel Schneider, Steffen Hagstotz</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We develop a fully analytical framework for predicting the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of dispersion measures (DM) for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the baryonification (BFC) model. BFC provides a computationally efficient alternative to expensive hydrodynamical simulations for modelling baryonic effects on cosmological scales. By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($μ$), and outer truncation ($δ$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs. Our work provides a self-consistent model that links gas density profiles to integrated DM statistics, enabling future constraints on baryonic feedback processes from FRB observations.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Luis E. Rodríguez, Andreas Reisenegger, Denis González-Caniulef, Cristóbal Petrovich</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of likely thermal ultraviolet emission from a few old neutron stars suggests that at least one internal heating mechanism is present in these stars. One proposed mechanism is rotochemical heating, in which the continuous contraction of the neutron star due to its spin-down produces chemical imbalances that induce Urca reactions, and the latter deposit heat in the neutron star core. If the protons in the star are superconducting, their energy gap suppresses the reactions, except in microscopic magnetized regions (such as quantized flux tubes) in which the protons act as if they were normal. Therefore, the strength of the internal magnetic field controls the rate at which reactions proceed and thus affects the thermal evolution of the neutron star. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the effect of an internal magnetic field in the superconducting interior on rotochemical heating. We simulate the evolution of neutron stars for different internal magnetic field strengths and neutron energy gaps, comparing the results to Hubble Space Telescope observations of old neutron stars. All the observational data can be accounted for if the proton energy gap is large ($\sim 1.5\,\mathrm{MeV}$) and the neutron energy gap is small ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{MeV}$) or vanishing, while the millisecond pulsar PSR~J0437$-$4715 needs to have a very weak internal magnetic field. Our results suggest that neutron-star cores are characterized by a large proton pairing gap and a small or vanishing neutron gap, and that millisecond pulsars have very weak internal magnetic fields. Under these conditions, rotochemical heating alone can account for the observed thermal emission of old neutron stars.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">J. Pratt</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Energetic particles interact with the plasma surrounding them, resonating with certain plasma waves to stabilize them while destabilizing others, and changing the character of the background turbulence in ways that have not been fully quantified or understood. Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Chris Done</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Black holes are the simplest possible objects, characterised by only mass and spin. We see them via accretion, so there is one more fundamental parameter which is the mass accretion rate. Here I will review how the data from both stellar and supermassive black holes can be fit into a framework where there is a major spectral transition at $\dot{m}=L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ where the optically thick disc is replaced by a hot flow. This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin. I review the multiple issues still remaining in this picture, most of which are connected to the geometry and nature of the X-ray corona, and the conflicting constraints on this which come from reflection spectroscopy and polarimetry.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most outstanding mysteries of modern astrophysics. While the standard Cold DM (CDM) model successfully explains observations on most astrophysical scales, DM particles have not yet been detected, leaving room for a plethora of different models. In order to identify their observable signatures, we use the AIDA-TNG cosmological simulation suite to predict the distributions of gas and neutral hydrogen (HI) in the CDM, Self-Interacting DM (SIDM), velocity-dependent SIDM (vSIDM), and Warm DM (WDM) models.
  We find that the DM models investigated have very limited impact on the median gas and HI profile of haloes. In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\rm vir}\sim10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.
  We investigate the galaxy-Ly$α$ cross-correlation function (\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies. We find that at $z=0$ vSIDM can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $10^{12}\lesssim M_{\rm vir}\lesssim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, while SIDM1 can be distinguished from CDM in haloes with $M_{\rm vir}\gtrsim10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Paloma Thevenet, Jeonguk Kim, Guang-Yao Zhao, Bong Won Sohn, Suk-Jin Yoon</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Previous VLBI kinematic studies of the blazar 3C 66A have unveiled complex jet kinematic behaviors. Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Previous VLBI kinematic studies of the blazar 3C 66A have unveiled complex jet kinematic behaviors. Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Austin MacMaster, Adam Rogers, Jason Fiege, Rebecca Man, Samar Safi-Harb</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The standard approach to modeling X-ray spectral data relies on local optimization methods, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. While effective for simple models and speedy spectral fitting, these local optimizers are prone to becoming trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional or degenerate parameter spaces, and typically require extensive user intervention. In this work, we introduce XFit, a global optimization method for fitting X-ray data, which makes extensive use of the Ferret evolutionary algorithm. XFit enables automated exploration of complex parameter spaces, efficient mapping of confidence intervals, and identification of degenerate solutions that may be overlooked by local methods. We demonstrate the performance of XFit using two representative X-ray sources: the Central Compact Object in Cassiopeia A and the supernova remnant G41.1-0.3. These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels. The automated mapping of parameter space offered by XFit makes it a powerful complement to existing spectral fitting tools, particularly as models and data quality become increasingly complex. Future work will expand the application of XFit to broader datasets and more physically motivated models.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">A. D. Supanitsky, S. E. Nuza</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recently, the Pierre Auger Observatory has found strong evidence supporting the extragalactic origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Despite several observed excesses in the distribution of arrival directions for the highest energy cosmic rays, the sources remain unidentified. Accretion shocks in galaxy clusters have been proposed as potential sources in the past. These immense shock waves, which can have radii on the order of megaparsecs, are generated by the infall of material from the intergalactic medium into the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters. In this work, we investigate the possibility that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are accelerated in these regions. Nearby massive galaxy clusters, including Virgo, are treated as a discrete component of the cluster mass distribution. Less massive galaxy clusters, as well as distant massive ones, are assumed to follow a continuous distribution in agreement with cluster mass statistics. We fit the flux at Earth and the composition profile measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, assuming the injection of different nuclear species by these sources, to determine the values of the model parameters. Our results indicate that cosmic ray acceleration in cluster accretion shocks may account for at least a fraction of the observed UHECR flux at energies below the suppression scale. At higher energies, direct acceleration from the thermal pool would be feasible only if local fluctuations create favorable conditions, such as magnetic fields about an order of magnitude stronger than those typically expected in cluster accretion shocks, or for particular shock normal-magnetic field configurations.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Vishnu Varma, Bernhard Müller</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the role of resolution and initial magnetic field strength on core-collapse supernovae in simulations of a non-rotating $13 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ progenitor. Specifically, we study the effect on shock revival, explosion dynamics, and the properties of the compact remnant. We run four models with different numerical grid resolutions with an initial central dipole field strength of $\mathord{\approx}10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$. Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\mathord{\approx}10^{10}\, \mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We perform the classification of black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems using deep neural networks applied to archival RXTE X-ray spectral data. We first construct two neural network models: one trained using only spectral flux values and another trained using both fluxes and their associated errors.

To gain physical interpretability of these networks, we fit all spectra with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a thermal disk component and a power-law. From this analysis, we identify the blackbody temperature, power-law index, the ratio of blackbody to power-law flux, the reduced $χ^2$, and the variance of the data as key parameters that likely contribute to the classification. We validate this inference by designing an additional neural network trained exclusively on this reduced parameter set, without using the spectral data directly. This parameter-based model achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the spectral models. Our results show that deep neural networks can not only classify compact objects in X-ray binaries with high accuracy but can also be interpreted in terms of physically meaningful spectral parameters derived from conventional X-ray spectral analysis.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alexander H. Nitz, Keisi Kacanja, Kanchan Soni</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A primary bottleneck in modern FFT-based matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is not raw processor throughput, but available memory bandwidth. Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\times$ for low-latency analysis.

  </h3>
  

  
  <p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alexander H. Nitz, Keisi Kacanja, Kanchan Soni</p>
  

  
  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A primary bottleneck in modern FFT-based matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences is not raw processor throughput, but available memory bandwidth. Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Chandranathan Anandavijayan, Pallavi Bhat</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The decay of magnetically dominated turbulence exhibits robust inverse transfer of magnetic energy even in the absence of net magnetic helicity, challenging traditional cascade-based phenomenology. While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Soorya Narayan, Anupreeta More, Sunil Choudhary, Sudhagar Suyamprakasam, Sukanta Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave (GW) detectors, we expect a significant rise in the detectable GW events. To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Hua Yue, Lin Nie, Yi-Qing Guo, Hong-Bo Hu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin mechanism of the cosmic-ray knee region remains an unresolved mystery, with acceleration, interaction, and propagation models drawing significant attention. The latest experimental observations of the PeV total spectrum, composition energy spectrum, and anisotropy-particularly the precise measurements of the proton spectrum by the LHAASO experiment-have provided crucial breakthroughs in uncovering its origin. Based on the latest LHAASO measurements of the proton energy spectrum, combined with cosmic-ray spectral and anisotropy data, this study proposes that the spectral index variation in the knee region arises from changes in the propagation coefficient. By introducing a knee position $\rm \mathcal{R}_{knee}$ and an index variation $\rm δ_{knee}$, we construct a rigidity-dependent double-power-law diffusion model to reproduce the knee-region spectral structure. Through modifications to the diffusion coefficient, we successfully replicate the observed knee-region spectral structure in the LHAASO proton spectrum and calculate the corresponding anisotropy. Under current data and model dependencies, a joint analysis of the energy spectrum and anisotropy does not support the propagation origin model of the cosmic-ray knee at a 95\% confidence level. We hope that future LHAASO experiments will provide precise measurements of the energy spectra and anisotropies of various nuclei in the knee region, thereby offering a definitive test of the propagation model as the origin mechanism of the knee-region spectral structure.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Fe K$α$ fluorescence line at 6.4 keV is a powerful probe of cold matter surrounding X-ray sources and has been widely used in various astrophysical contexts. The X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM can measure line shifts with unprecedented precision of $\sim$0.2 eV, equivalent to a line-of-sight velocity of $\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. At this level of accuracy, however, several factors that influence the line energy must be carefully considered prior to astrophysical interpretation. One such important factor is the ionization degree, Fe$^{q+}$. The K$α$ line shifts redward by $\sim$4 eV as $q$ increases from 0 (neutral) to 8 (Ar-like). Additionally, the accompanying Fe K$β$ line at 7.06 keV shifts blueward by $\sim$30 eV from $q=0$ to 8. We demonstrate that this effect is actually observable in the XRISM data of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3 (Cen X-3). We advocate that the differential energy shift between the K$α$ and K$β$ line provides a robust estimate of $q$ by decoupling from other effects that shift the two lines in the same direction. We derived $q \sim 5$ (Sc-like) for the fluorescing matter by comparing the observation with atomic structure calculations of our own and in the literature. By accounting for the derived charge state and the corresponding shift in the rest-frame line energy, we made corrections for this effect and reached a consistent residual shift among the K$α$, K$β$, and the optical measurement attributable to the systemic velocity of the system. Consequently, we obtained a new constraint on the location of the cold matter. This ionization effect needs to be assessed in all use cases of the Fe K$α$ line shift beyond Cen X-3, and the proposed metric is generally applicable to all of them.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Salvatore Orlando</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">(Abridged) Recent JWST observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A) reveal unprecedented ejecta substructure, including a web of filaments and the enigmatic "Green Monster" (GM), characterized by nearly circular holes and rings. These features provide new constraints on supernova (SN) explosion physics and ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions. We present high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a neutrino-driven SN explosion tailored to Cas A, following the system from core collapse to an age of $\sim 1000$ yr. The models include key physical processes such as hydrodynamic instabilities, Ni-bubble effects, radiative cooling, non-equilibrium ionization, and electron-ion temperature equilibration. Our results show that the filamentary ejecta network naturally forms during the early explosion due to the interaction of neutrino-driven bubbles and instabilities, retaining a memory of the initial conditions before being progressively modified by the reverse shock. The GM morphology is reproduced by the interaction of dense ejecta clumps with an asymmetric, forward-shocked CSM shell, with radiative cooling enhancing fragmentation and generating the observed holes and rings. Overall, our study demonstrates that Cas A's complex morphology reflects both the imprint of the explosion mechanism and subsequent ejecta-CSM interactions.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shyam S. Sharma, Tetsuya Hashimoto, Tomotsugu Goto, Sanjay Kudale, Sujin Eie, Simon C. -C. Ho</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Individual radio pulses from a pulsar are directly linked to the underlying emission processes and the associated magnetic field geometry within its magnetosphere. Thus, single-pulse studies across frequencies can provide crucial insights into the physics of radio emission. Multiple studies have investigated single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 with widely separated discrete frequencies, reporting the broadband nature of pulsar emission. However, understanding the frequency evolution of these correlations has been limited by poor frequency sampling, and the physical origin of these correlations remains unexplored. We present a detailed study of single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 at low radio frequencies using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), with well-sampled time series spanning 300-1460 MHz. We derived an inverted flux spectrum for this pulsar, with a turnover near 470 MHz. We used flux-calibrated and scintillation-corrected single pulses to study correlations across frequencies. Our results show that maximum correlations consistently occur near the longitude of the central component, with correlation strength exceeding 69\% for all frequency combinations, while outer components exhibit correlations above 46\%. These findings indicate very strong inter-frequency correlations, with no anticorrelations detected. No cross-component correlations were observed; only corresponding components correlate across frequencies. The longitudes of maximum correlation do not coincide with the intensity peaks of the average profile. We also examine how correlations vary with frequency at selected fiducial longitudes. The observations reported in this work favor curvature radiation from relativistic charge bunches in the pulsar plasma; however, reproducing the correlation curves along with spectra remains an open challenge.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Individual radio pulses from a pulsar are directly linked to the underlying emission processes and the associated magnetic field geometry within its magnetosphere. Thus, single-pulse studies across frequencies can provide crucial insights into the physics of radio emission. Multiple studies have investigated single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 with widely separated discrete frequencies, reporting the broadband nature of pulsar emission. However, understanding the frequency evolution of these correlations has been limited by poor frequency sampling, and the physical origin of these correlations remains unexplored. We present a detailed study of single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 at low radio frequencies using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), with well-sampled time series spanning 300-1460 MHz. We derived an inverted flux spectrum for this pulsar, with a turnover near 470 MHz. We used flux-calibrated and scintillation-corrected single pulses to study correlations across frequencies. Our results show that maximum correlations consistently occur near the longitude of the central component, with correlation strength exceeding 69\% for all frequency combinations, while outer components exhibit correlations above 46\%. These findings indicate very strong inter-frequency correlations, with no anticorrelations detected. No cross-component correlations were observed; only corresponding components correlate across frequencies. The longitudes of maximum correlation do not coincide with the intensity peaks of the average profile. We also examine how correlations vary with frequency at selected fiducial longitudes. The observations reported in this work favor curvature radiation from relativistic charge bunches in the pulsar plasma; however, reproducing the correlation curves along with spectra remains an open challenge.</p>
