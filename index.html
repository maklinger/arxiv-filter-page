</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Piotr Płonka, Agnieszka Janiuk</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ramandeep Gill, Jiang He, Jonathan Granot, Jian-Chao Sun, Shuang-Nan Zhang, Yuan-Hao Wang, Johannes Hulsman, Nicolas Produit, Shao-Lin Xiong</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $γ$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $γ$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\mathcal{F}_{-5}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\,σ$) of about $2.5\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A small fraction of X-ray photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), after escaping the relativistic jet, are scattered by electrons in the circumburst medium. Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $γ$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $γ-γ$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $α$. In particular, spectra with $α> -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Murray Brightman, Joahan Castañeda Jaimes, Daniel Stern, Brian Grefenstette</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours. An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3<Γ<0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The properties of these NuSTAR FXTs most resemble low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and would be much more common than their higher-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae. This provides a precious clue to the nature of the progenitor of this peculiar GRB, which could also be present in other bursts that feature a long quiescence followed by a bright emission episode with a hard spectrum.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Our understanding of the $γ$-ray sky has greatly advanced, yet studying the unresolved $γ$-ray background (UGRB) can unveil the nature of the faintest $γ$-ray source populations in the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations between the UGRB and tracers of large-scale cosmic structure allow us to infer which sources contribute the most to this emission. In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $γ$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved γ-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $γ$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.</p>

Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved γ-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $γ$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Emma Dreas, Andrea Pavan, Riccardo Ciolfi, Annalisa Celotti</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This study extends the 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a jet emerging from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger presented in Pavan et al. (2023), in which an incipient jet was manually injected into the realistic environment imported from a previous general-relativistic MHD simulation of a merging BNS system. The jet evolution is followed up to almost 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Our results reveal that the jet faces challenges in penetrating the dense surroundings, leading to a barely successful outflow that exhibits structural asymmetries and low Lorentz factors. By the end of the extended simulation, 98% of the jet energy is converted to kinetic form and its angular structure is stabilized. The physical quantities inferred thus provide reliable inputs for afterglow emission calculations. This work demonstrates a method for simulating jets in 3D up to nearly ballistic regimes that is general and ready to be applied to any jet in a BNS merger context.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Run-Chao Chen, Jun Yang, Yi-Han Iris Yin, Bin-Bin Zhang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Coherent oscillations at kilohertz frequencies have recently been detected in a small number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), suggesting quasi-periodic dynamics in their central engines. A prominent example is GRB~230307A, which exhibited a brief, highly coherent, energy-dependent periodic signal interpreted as the possible spin signature of a nascent millisecond magnetar formed after a compact binary merger. Motivated by these developments, we conducted a comprehensive search for similar signals, accounting for both temporal and spectral dependencies, in 532 short GRBs with time-tagged event data recorded by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) onboard the \textit{Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory}. Within this sample, we identify a single statistically significant case: GRB~960616 (BATSE trigger~5502), in which the $\sim$30~ms main emission episode is coherently modulated at 1100~Hz, with the strongest modulation above 320~keV and a fractional amplitude of $\sim$47\%. Assuming the presence of a coherent periodic modulation, we use data-driven Monte Carlo simulations to place an upper limit of $\sim$8\% on the fraction of the total radiated energy that can be modulated by the QPO. This event, exhibiting a periodicity at $\sim$0.91~ms, further supports the possibility that millisecond periodicities can arise during GRBs in merger-driven scenarios.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has produced the largest database of all-sky observations in gamma rays with its continuous data with high time and energy resolutions. These data contain a wealth of unidentified transient events that did not trigger the detectors for various reasons. We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known-event flagging as well as unknown-event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast ($<$1$\,$hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of $g\sim22.2$ AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach.

However, we find that $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Low--luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D_L\sim6.5\times10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim1\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\lesssim7.0\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Nilanjana Bagchi Aurpa, Abha Dev Habib, Nisha Rani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful probe of the cosmic expansion history far beyond the redshift range accessible to Type Ia supernovae. However, the calibration of GRB luminosity correlations is hindered by the circularity problem, which arises from assuming a fiducial cosmological model during calibration. In this work, we perform a model independent calibration of GRB luminosity relations using observational Hubble parameter H(z) data from the A220 and J220 compilations, thereby avoiding explicit cosmological assumptions. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets. While the Amati Parameters obtained from GRBs caibrated from the ANN and BNN results are consistent with previous low redshifts calibrations using model-independent methods, the BNN approach provides a more robust framework.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning, Omer Bromberg, Tsvi Piran</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present the distribution of the intrinsic duration of gamma-ray bursts' prompt emission. This expands upon the analysis of Bromberg et al., 2012 and Bromberg et al. 2013 who showed evidence for collapsar progenitors based on the presence of a plateau in the distribution of $T_{90}$, the duration over which 90 % of the prompt emission is observed for any given detector. We confirm the presence of this plateau in the distribution of duration corrected for cosmological time dilation (what we call intrinsic duration, $T_{int}$), but shifted to smaller timescales by a factor of $1/(1+z_{\rm av}) \sim 1/3$, where $z_{\rm av}$ is the average GRB redshift. More significantly, we show this plateau is only present in the sample of GRBs with redshifts greater than $(1+z) \sim 2$, and does not appear in the duration distribution of lower redshift GRBs. This result aligns with suggestions that the low redshift population of GRBs has a significant contribution from non-collapsar progenitors (while the high redshift sample is dominated by collapsars). We also show the difference in this distribution between spectrally hard and soft GRBs, confirming that a plateau is only present for the soft subset of GRBs. However, when we separate the soft GRBs into low and high redshift subsets, we find that only the high redshift soft GRBs show evidence of a plateau, while the low-redshift soft GRBs do not. This suggests there exists a significant subset of spectrally soft non-collapsar progenitors at low redshift. Finally, we use the end time of the plateau to constrain the GRB progenitor density profile and radius, and show the maximum size of a collapsar is a few tenths of a solar radius.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Dhruv K. Desai, Luciano Combi, Daniel M. Siegel, Brian D. Metzger</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of the remnant of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is uncertain. Though certainly a black hole (BH) in the cases of the most massive BNSs, X-ray lightcurves from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows suggest a neutron star (NS) as a viable candidate for both the merger remnant as well as the central engine of these transients. When jointly observed with gravitational waves (GWs), X-ray lightcurves from BNS merger events could provide critical constraints on the remnant's nature. We aim to assess the current and future capabilities to detect a NS remnant through X-ray observations following GW detections. To this end, we simulate GW signals from BNS mergers and the subsequent X-ray emission from newborn millisecond magnetars. The GW detectability is modeled for both current and next-generation interferometers, while the X-ray emission is reproduced using a dedicated numerical code that models magnetar spin-down and ejecta dynamics informed by numerical-relativity simulations. In our simulations, 2% - 16% of BNS mergers form millisecond magnetars. Among these, up to 70% could be detectable, amounting to up to 1 millisecond magnetar detection per year with SVOM/MXT-like instruments during the LIGO Virgo KAGRA LIGO India (LVKI) O5 run, with optimal detectability occurring about 2 hours post-merger. For next-generation GW interferometers, this rate could increase by up to three orders of magnitude, with peak detectability 3 to 4 hours post-merger. We also explore how the magnetar's magnetic field strength and observer viewing angle affect detectability and discuss optimized observational strategies.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\%, 1.5\%, and 3.5\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations. We propose three distinct non-simultaneous survey strategies, among them an active galactic nuclei (AGN) strategy for long-term monitoring of $\sim$200 AGN with $<$1-day cadence.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Matteo Pracchia, Om Sharan Salafia</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are thought to be primarily associated with binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The SGRB population can therefore be scrutinized to look for signatures of the delay time between the formation of the progenitor massive star binary and the eventual merger, which could produce an evolution of the cosmic rate density of such events whose shape departs from that of the cosmic star formation history (CSFH). To that purpose, we study a large sample of SGRBs within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with a particular focus on the delay time distribution (DTD) of the population. Following previous studies, we model the DTD either as a power-law with a minimum time delay or as a log-normal function. We consider two models for the intrinsic SGRB luminosity distribution: an empirical luminosity function (ELF) with a doubly broken power-law shape, and one based on a quasi-universal structured jet (QUSJ) model. Regardless of the chosen parametrization, we find average time delays $10\lesssim \langle τ_\mathrm{d}\mathrm\rangle/\mathrm{Myr}\lesssim 800$ and a minimum delay time $τ_\mathrm{d,min}\lesssim 350\,\mathrm{Myr}$, in contrast with previous studies that found long delay times of few Gyr. We demonstrate that the cause of the longer inferred time delays in past studies most likely resides in an incorrect treatment of selection effects.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Haojia Xia, Shichuan Chen, Hong-Bo Li, Enping Zhou, Ren-Xin Xu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The nature of the central engine powering short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remains a key open question in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xiao-Yan Li, Tong Liu, Bao-Quan Huang, Chen Deng</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Plateau features are frequently observed in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), yet their physical origins remain under debate. In this work, we compile a sample of 124 GRBs with known redshifts and simultaneous X-ray and optical afterglow observations. We categorize them into four subsets based on the existence of plateaus and the bands in which they appear. Namely, Dataset 1: plateaus are detected simultaneously in both X-ray and optical bands (75 bursts); Dataset 2: plateaus are only in X-rays (15 bursts); Dataset 3: plateaus appear only in the optical (17 bursts); Dataset 4: no plateaus in either band (17 bursts). We employ these datasets to test the applicability of the energy-injection model by examining whether the temporal decay index $α$ and the spectral index $β$ of GRB afterglows simultaneously satisfy the closure relations in X-ray and optical bands. We find that 47 bursts of Dataset 1 simultaneously obey the closure relations in both bands under the conditions of the electron spectral index $p>2$ and the injection parameter $q\in (0, 0.5)$, and 69 of the dataset for $p>1$ and $q\in (0, 0.8)$, providing a strong support for the energy-injection interpretation. However, for Datasets 2 and 3, although $α$ and $β$ of the plateaus mostly satisfy the closure relations, those in the other band show significant deviations, which implies that bursts with a single-band plateau are inconsistent with the interpretation of energy injection. Furthermore, we also compare the isotropic X-ray energy of plateaus with the rotational energy budget of millisecond magnetars.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the gamma-ray spectrum in the MeV range arising from electron-positron pair annihilation in fireballs associated with magnetar giant flares (MGFs), motivated by the recent observation of a MeV gamma-ray line feature in a bright gamma-ray burst, GRB~221009A. We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xue-Zhao Chang, HouJun Lü, Jia-Ming Chen, En-Wei Liang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($Γ_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($σ_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($η$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $Γ_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+σ_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($η\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($σ_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $ν\barν$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($Γ_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($σ_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($η$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $Γ_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+σ_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($η\gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($σ_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $ν\barν$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xueying Shao, He Gao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations. This study underscores the value of combined MeV-TeV observations in probing GRB emission mechanisms.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Liang Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Over the past two decades, the \textit{Swift} and \textit{Fermi} missions have identified a rare class of ``double-trigger'' gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that produce two independent trigger events. These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($τ_{\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Shen-Shi Du, Yi Gong, Jun-Jie Wei, Zi-Ke Liu, Zhi-Qiang You, Yan-Zhi Meng, Xing-Jiang Zhu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most potent probes of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), offering direct constraints on the quantum gravity energy scale ($E_{\rm QG}$) based on observations of energy-dependent time lags. Individual GRBs with well-defined positive-to-negative lag transitions have been used to set lower limits on $E_{\rm QG}$, but they suffer from uncertainties of spectral-lag measurements and systematics due to theoretical modeling of each burst. Here, we combine observations of 32 GRBs with positive-to-negative lag transitions to derive a statistically robust constraint on $E_{\rm QG}$ through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We find that the dominant systematic uncertainty in LIV constraints arises from the intrinsic lag modeling. Accounting for this uncertainty with cubic spline interpolation, we derive robust limits of $E_{\rm QG,1} \ge 4.37 \times 10^{16}$~GeV for linear LIV and $E_{\rm QG,2} \ge 3.02 \times 10^{8}$~GeV for quadratic LIV. We find that the probability for LIV, i.e., $E_{\rm QG,1}$ being below the Planck scale, is estimated to be around 90\%, which we conclude as no significant evidence for LIV signatures in current GRB spectral lag observations. Our hierarchical approach provides a rigorous statistical framework for future LIV searches and can be extended to incorporate multi-messenger observations.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tatsuya Matsumoto</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of late-time radio flares in tidal disruption events remains unclear. In particular, the peculiar radio flare observed in AT2018hyz has motivated two leading scenarios: a delayed outflow launched $\sim1000\,\rm days$ after discovery, or an off-axis relativistic jet directed far from our line of sight. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging provides the most direct way to distinguish between these scenarios. In this paper, we calculate synthetic radio images for both models and examine their observational signatures. The motion of the emission centroid is the most powerful diagnostic for breaking the degeneracy. In the delayed-outflow scenario, the centroid motion is confined within a non-relativistic distance, whereas in the off-axis jet scenario it exhibits apparent superluminal motion. Detecting such superluminal motion would therefore provide a smoking-gun signature of the off-axis jet interpretation. We also find that the jet image exhibits characteristic features, including a non-monotonic evolution of the image aspect ratio. These results are expected to be generic and applicable to other jetted explosions, such as microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">S. Bala, P. Veres, A. Goldstein, R. Sonawane, R. Samanta, S. Iyyani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</p>

Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($β_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $β_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $β_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe. The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Jonathan Granot, Hagai B. Perets, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Brendan O'Connor</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB$\;$250702B is the longest GRB recorded so far, with multiple gamma-ray emission episodes spread over a duration exceeding $25\;$ks and a weaker soft X-ray pre-peak $\sim1\;$day gradually rising emission. It is offset from its host galaxy center by $\sim5.7\;$kpc, and displays a long-lived afterglow emission in radio to X-ray. Its true nature is unclear, with the two leading candidate classes of objects being a peculiar type of ultra-long GRB and a tidal disruption event (TDE) by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). Here, we consider the latter, mTDE origin. We model the afterglow data, finding a stratified external density profile $\propto r^{-k}$ with $k=1.60\pm0.17$, consistent with Bondi accretion of the interstellar medium (of initial number density $n_{\rm ISM}=n_0\;{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and sound speed $c_s=c_{s,6}10^6\;{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$) for which $n(r)\approx n_{\rm ISM}(r/R_{\rm B})^{-3/2}$ within the Bondi radius $R_{\rm B}$. Moreover, we use the implied density normalization to infer the IMBH mass within this model, finding $M_\bullet\approx\left(6.55^{+3.51}_{-2.29}\right)\times10^3\,n_0^{-2/3}\,c_{s,6}^{2}(1+\mathcal{M}^2)\;M_\odot$ where $\mathcal{M}\equiv v_{\rm BH}/c_s$ is the IMBH's Mach number relative to the ISM. Together with an upper limit on $M_\bullet<\frac{c^3}{G}\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z} \lesssim5\times10^4\,M_\odot$ from the source-frame minimum variability time $t_{\rm MV,src}\!=\!\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z}\!\approx\!0.5\;$s this implies $v_{\rm BH}\lesssim 28\,n_0^{1/3}\;{\rm km\;s^{-1}}$. We show that a mTDE of a main-sequence star (but not of a white dwarf) can explain the duration and energetics of GRB$\;$250702B. The gradual rise to the peak may be caused by gradual circularization and accretion disk buildup, leading to an increase in the jet's power and Lorentz factor.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Manuele Maistrello, Romain Maccary, Cristiano Guidorzi</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present FAST-MEPSA, an optimised version of the MEPSA algorithm developed to detect peaks in uniformly sampled time series affected by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present FAST-MEPSA, an optimised version of the MEPSA algorithm developed to detect peaks in uniformly sampled time series affected by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired. The code is made publicly available.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Kanako Nakama, Kazumi Kashiyama, Nobuhiro Shimizu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Both observational and theoretical studies indicate that the central engine of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is intrinsically time-variable, implying jet inhomogeneity. A jet with an inhomogeneous Lorentz factor distribution develops internal shocks both below and above the photosphere, relaxing toward homologous expansion. Below the photosphere, neutrons, whose mean free paths are much longer than those of charged particles, play an essential role in the dissipation process. Using neutron-inclusive shell simulations with initial conditions based on the collapsar scenario, we link the statistical inhomogeneity of the jet at the breakout of the progenitor to the dissipation that occurs inside and outside the photosphere, and calculate the GeV-TeV neutrino counterpart originated from inelastic neutron-proton interactions consistently with the prompt gamma-ray emission. We find that the peak energy of the GeV-TeV neutrinos is in 10-30 GeV irrespective to the baryon loading factor of the jet, with the high-energy tail extending into the TeV range as the amplitude of the time variability becomes stronger. When gamma-ray emission is efficient as in typical GRBs (i.e., the gamma-ray radiation efficiency with respect to the total jet power is approximately 100%, the radiative efficiency of GeV-TeV neutrinos remains 0.1-10%. By contrast, when the gamma-ray radiation efficiency is relatively low (< 10%) for jets where a large fraction of the energy is dissipated below the photosphere, the neutrino efficiency can increase up to 20%. This suggests that GRBs with relatively low gamma-ray luminosities, as well as X-ray-rich transients, can be promising targets for ongoing and future GeV-TeV neutrino transient searches.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$σ$ region of the galaxy mass model.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Stefano Profumo, Kally Wen</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $γ$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a "plateau" phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a "plateau" phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xiao-Hong Zhao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</p>

Tanvir, Yun Wang, Yu Rong, Run-Duo Liang, Zhi-Xing Ling, Dong Xu, Zhi-Ping Jin, Da-Ming Wei</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $γ$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $γ$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $γ$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{γ,{\rm iso}}\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\sim5\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $γ$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $γ$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $γ$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{γ,{\rm iso}}\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\sim5\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Chakraborty, L. Resmi, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Amit Kumar, Sayan Chakrabarti, Santabrata Das</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass.

In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Parth Bambhaniya, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">High-energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, X-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts are powered by mechanisms that convert gravitational or rotational energy into radiation, jets, and relativistic outflows. Understanding the physics of these processes remains a major challenge. Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.</p>

Black holes have traditionally served as the central engines behind such phenomena, with well established energy extraction mechanisms including the Penrose process, the Blandford-Znajek process, and the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. However, studies in general relativity indicate that, under certain conditions, gravitational collapse may lead to the formation of naked singularities or other horizonless compact objects, which could in principle allow more efficient energy extraction than classical black holes. This brief review summarizes recent progress on energy extraction mechanisms in naked singularity spacetimes. We examine the roles of rotation, electromagnetic fields, and particle interactions in shaping extraction efficiency and dynamics. Particular attention is given to negative energy orbits and ergoregion physics, which enable Penrose type and magnetic Penrose mechanisms without an event horizon. We also discuss collisional Penrose processes and particle acceleration near the singularity, emphasizing their potential astrophysical implications. By comparing extraction efficiencies and physical conditions in black holes and naked singularities, we highlight how the absence of a horizon fundamentally alters the dynamics of energy release. These results suggest that naked singularities may serve as natural laboratories for strong field gravity and as alternative engines for high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the era of multi-messenger observations.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The rate of observed gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) indicates the existence of more than one short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) similar to GW/sGRB 170817A within the total gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) recorded by satellite detectors such as BATSE, Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT). We investigated sGRBs in the Fermi-GBM dataset based on their MeV-GeV $γ$-ray emission features, to identify sGRBs similar to sGRB 170817A. Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations. The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$. A shallower external medium density profile ($k<2$) departs from the canonical approximation of a steady wind ($k=2$) from the progenitor star and may indicate a non-steady wind or a transition to an interstellar medium.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB 250114A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) which triggered the Swift/BAT with a spectroscopic high-redshift at $z = 4.732$. The light curve of the prompt emission is composed of three distinct emission episodes, which are separated by quiescent gaps ranging from tens to hundreds of seconds. While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $γ$-ray detectability threshold. In this paper, we propose a magnetar as the central engine of GRB 250114A by fitting the X-ray light curve, and infer a magnetic field strength $B_{\rm p}=13.24^{+1.73}_{-5.84} \, \times10^{15}\ \mathrm{G}$ and an initial spin period $P_{0}=14.31^{+0.93}_{-3.16} \, \mathrm{ms}$ of magnetar, with a jet correction, fall within a reasonable range. Furthermore, we also compare the prompt emission, X-ray afterglow, $E_{\mathrm p}$-$E_{γ,\mathrm{iso}}$, and $\varepsilon-$distribution of GBR 250114A with those of other high-$z$ sample-GRBs, and find no significant statistical differences between them.</p>

In this paper, we propose a magnetar as the central engine of GRB 250114A by fitting the X-ray light curve, and infer a magnetic field strength $B_{\rm p}=13.24^{+1.73}_{-5.84} \, \times10^{15}\ \mathrm{G}$ and an initial spin period $P_{0}=14.31^{+0.93}_{-3.16} \, \mathrm{ms}$ of magnetar, with a jet correction, fall within a reasonable range. Furthermore, we also compare the prompt emission, X-ray afterglow, $E_{\mathrm p}$-$E_{γ,\mathrm{iso}}$, and $\varepsilon-$distribution of GBR 250114A with those of other high-$z$ sample-GRBs, and find no significant statistical differences between them.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Pragyan Pratim Bordoloi, Shubh Mittal, Shabnam Iyyani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is commonly attributed to non-thermal radiation processes operating in the optically thin regions of a relativistic outflow. Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $Γ\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\%$-$20\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $δ\sim 1.8$. The derived Comptonisation parameters indicate moderate $y$ values ($\sim 1$-$3$), optical depths $τ\sim 0.2$-$0.6$, and dissipation radii just above the photosphere, consistent with mildly relativistic ($γ_{\min} \sim 1.2$-$2.6$), photon-dominated, low-magnetic-field dissipation environments. Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">C. R. Das</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Strange quark matter (SQM) is considered a possible true ground state of QCD at high densities. This idea motivates research on exotic compact objects and certain cosmic-ray phenomena. For instance, the remnant HESS J1731-347 contains a low-mass neutron star, about $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ $M_\odot$ and $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km in radius, making it a strong candidate for a strange quark star. Other events, such as GW170817 and GRB 250702B, provide conditions that may favor the formation of strangelets. Strangelets are stable clusters of SQM, potentially created during the phase transition between the 2SC and CFL color-superconducting states. These clusters could generate monochromatic $γ$-ray lines in very-high-energy spectra through self-annihilation. This work analyzes the stability of strangelets, production cross-sections, and mass-to-charge ratios using QCD-based models. Data from H.E.S.S., Fermi-LAT, MAGIC-II, and CTA were used to set limits on spectral features and possible fluxes. Detecting narrow $γ$-ray lines will require improved instrument sensitivity. By integrating evidence from multimessenger astrophysics and dense QCD simulations, this study investigates the equations of state for compact stars and explores the potential cosmological influence of SQM.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ziyan Zhu, Qingquan Jiang, Yu Liu, Puxun Wu, Nan Liang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this work, we constrain the phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) model using \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray burst (GRB) dataset and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). Through a joint Bayesian analysis, we perform a cosmological comparative assessment of the $Λ$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL models with the phenomenological IDE model. For the phenomenological IDE model in a flat universe with \emph{Fermi} samples and DESI DR2, we obtain: $ξ=2.63^{+0.63}_{-0.52}$, $ξ+ 3w_X = -0.98^{+1.90}_{-2.07}$ with the GOLD sample ($1.4\le z \le5.6$) and $ξ=2.83^{+0.63}_{-0.58}$, $ξ+ 3w_X = 0.03^{+1.35}_{-1.33}$ with the FULL sample ($1.4\le z \le8.2$), respectively. Our analysis shows that the $Λ$CDM model without interaction ($ξ=3$, $ξ+ 3w_X = 0$) is consistent with the latest \emph{Fermi} sample and DESI DR2 at $1σ$ confidence level.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Martyna Chruślińska, Mirko Curti, Ruediger Pakmor, Annalisa De Cia, Jorryt Matthee, Aniket Bhagwat, Stephanie Monty</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Due to their different nucleosynthetic origin, a stellar population produces oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) on different timescales and their relative abundance can deviate strongly from solar. Galaxy formation models should treat these elements separately, as they play a distinct role in shaping physical phenomena. For example, oxygen mainly sets the gas cooling rate, while the iron abundance sets stellar atmosphere opacities impacting stellar evolution, spectra and feedback. Observations of star-forming galaxies usually only constrain gas-phase oxygen abundance, vastly limiting our capabilities of separating the cosmic evolution of oxygen and iron. Here, we present an observationally-motivated framework to scale the cosmic evolution of O and Fe abundances. We apply the relation between the alpha-enhancement and galaxies' specific star formation rate ([O/Fe]-sSFR; Chruslinska et al. 2024) to derive the Fe and O-dependent cosmic star formation history (cSFH). We find that star formation with near-solar O/Fe is rare: at least 70% of the integrated cosmic stellar mass forms at non-solar O/Fe. The cosmic average metallicity is generally lower in [Fe/H] than in [O/H] (by up to a factor 3), with the offset increasing from redshifts z=0 to z~3 and then approaching the core-collapse O/Fe ratio. We validate our results against samples that probe the Fe-dependent cSFH in different regimes such as absorption-derived <[Fe/H]> from long gamma-ray bursts. Our results impact the interpretations of stellar and galaxy spectra and the predicted rates of transients, especially those linked to metal-poor progenitors (e.g., black hole mergers).</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are challenging to identify due to their transient nature, complex temporal profiles, and limited observational datasets. We address this with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network integrated with an Adaptive Frequency Feature Enhancement module and physics-informed data augmentation. Our framework generates 100,000 synthetic GRB samples, expanding training data diversity and volume while preserving physical fidelity-especially for low-significance events. The model achieves 97.46% classification accuracy, outperforming all tested variants with conventional enhancement modules, highlighting enhanced domain-specific feature capture. Feature visualization shows model focuses on deep-seated morphological features and confirms the capability of extracting physically meaningful burst characteristics. Dimensionality reduction and clustering reveal GRBs with similar morphologies or progenitor origins cluster in the feature space, linking learned features to physical properties. This perhaps offers a novel diagnostic tool for identifying kilonova- and supernova-associated GRB candidates, establishing criteria to enhance multi-messenger early-warning systems. The framework aids current time-domain surveys, generalizes to other rare transients, and advances automated detection in large-volume observational data.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are challenging to identify due to their transient nature, complex temporal profiles, and limited observational datasets. We address this with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network integrated with an Adaptive Frequency Feature Enhancement module and physics-informed data augmentation. Our framework generates 100,000 synthetic GRB samples, expanding training data diversity and volume while preserving physical fidelity-especially for low-significance events. The model achieves 97.46% classification accuracy, outperforming all tested variants with conventional enhancement modules, highlighting enhanced domain-specific feature capture. Feature visualization shows model focuses on deep-seated morphological features and confirms the capability of extracting physically meaningful burst characteristics. Dimensionality reduction and clustering reveal GRBs with similar morphologies or progenitor origins cluster in the feature space, linking learned features to physical properties. This perhaps offers a novel diagnostic tool for identifying kilonova- and supernova-associated GRB candidates, establishing criteria to enhance multi-messenger early-warning systems. The framework aids current time-domain surveys, generalizes to other rare transients, and advances automated detection in large-volume observational data.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Suo-Ning Wang, Bin-Bin Zhang, Rubén García-Benito</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events -- including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 < z < 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Accurate spectral analysis of high-energy astrophysical sources often relies on comparing observed data to incident spectral models convolved with the instrument response. However, for Gamma-Ray Bursts and other high-energy transient events observed at high count rates, significant distortions (e.g., pile-up, dead time, and large signal trailing) are introduced, complicating this analysis. We present a method framework to address the model dependence problem, especially to solve the problem of energy spectrum distortion caused by instrument signal pile-up due to high counting rate and high-rate effects, applicable to X-ray, gamma-ray, and particle detectors. Our approach combines physics-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a model-independent spectral inversion technique. The MC simulations quantify instrumental effects and enable correction of the distorted spectrum. Subsequently, the inversion step reconstructs the incident spectrum using an inverse response matrix approach, conceptually equivalent to deconvolving the detector response. The inversion employs a Convolutional Neural Network, selected for its numerical stability and effective handling of complex detector responses. Validation using simulations across diverse input spectra demonstrates high fidelity. Specifically, for 27 different parameter sets of the brightest gamma-ray bursts, goodness-of-fit tests confirm the reconstructed spectra are in excellent statistical agreement with the input spectra, and residuals are typically within $\pm 2σ$. This method enables precise analysis of intense transients and other high-flux events, overcoming limitations imposed by instrumental effects in traditional analyses.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yun-Feng Wei, Tong Liu, Bao-Quan Huang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The observable characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mainly determined by the jet propagation within the disk. In the massive collapsar scenario, we consider that the mass and metallicity of progenitor stars can significantly affect the jet durations and luminosities, which in turn influence whether the jet can break out from AGN disks. For the cases with low metallicity, massive stars tend to keep their massive envelopes. Thus the hyperaccretion of these envelopes onto the newborn black holes (BHs) can prolong the activity duration of the central engine, thereby allowing the jets to potentially break out from the disks. For successful jets, we further study their prompt emission and afterglows for different supermassive BHs and locations and discuss the detectability of these signals by instruments such as \emph{Swift} and Einstein Probe. Future related observations will help constrain the structure, components, and evolutionary history of AGN disks and the massive stars embedded within them.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The General Coordinates Network (GCN) is NASA's time-domain and multi-messenger alert system. GCN distributes two data products - automated ``Notices,'' and human-generated ``Circulars,'' that report the observations of high-energy and multi-messenger astronomical transients. The flexible and non-structured format of GCN Circulars, comprising of more than 40500 Circulars accumulated over three decades, makes it challenging to manually extract observational information, such as redshift or observed wavebands. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the automated parsing of transient reports. We develop a neural topic modeling pipeline with open-source tools for the automatic clustering and summarization of astrophysical topics in the Circulars database. Using neural topic modeling and contrastive fine-tuning, we classify Circulars based on their observation wavebands and messengers. Additionally, we separate gravitational wave (GW) event clusters and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from the Circulars database. Finally, using the open-source Mistral model, we implement a system to automatically extract gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshift information from the Circulars archive, without the need for any training. Evaluation against the manually curated Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRB table shows that our simple system, with the help of prompt-tuning, output parsing, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), can achieve an accuracy of 97.2 % for redshift-containing Circulars. Our neural search enhanced RAG pipeline accurately retrieved 96.8 % of redshift circulars from the manually curated database. Our study demonstrates the potential of LLMs, to automate and enhance astronomical text mining, and provides a foundation work for future advances in transient alert analysis.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Razzaque, JC. Joshi, S. Majumder, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Qin-Mei Li, Qi-Bin Sun, Sheng-Bang Qian, Si-Yuan Zhu, Fu-Xing Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The origin of the Universe and its material content remains one of the most fundamental questions in science. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and high-redshift detectability, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their $ T_{90} $ duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the $ T_{90} $ classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a kilonova-associated GRB (KN/GRBs) sample, we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts ($ z < 1 $). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Zachary Gelles, Andrew Chael, Eliot Quataert</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We analyze the polarization of optically thin, stationary, axisymmetric black hole jets at scales of order the light cylinder radius. Our work generalizes the face-on results of Gelles et al. (2025) to arbitrary viewing inclination. Due to a combination of geometry and relativistic aberration, the polarization of the jet is not left-right symmetric, and the degree of asymmetry can shed light on both the viewing angle and the plasma bulk Lorentz factor. We show that there is always a radius in the jet at which the polarization transitions from azimuthal to radial; this radius is different along the spine and limb of the jet. We propose metrics that can be used to constrain the black hole spin, inclination angle, and plasma Lorentz factor from these polarimetric signatures, and we discuss the impact of limb-brightening on these measurements. We anticipate that these polarimetric signatures can be studied with current or forthcoming data in M87, NGC 315, NGC 4261, Centaurus A, Cygnus A, and other systems. Observations of the polarization of the base of the counter-jet in higher inclination sources would provide a particularly promising probe of black hole spin.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Faizuddin Ahmed, Ahmad Al-Badawi, İzzet Sakallı</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $α$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Sol Gutiérrez-Lara, Daniel C. M. Palumbo, Michael D. Johnson</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first images of a black hole using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the near future, extensions of the EHT such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will allow access to finer-scale features, such as a black hole's ''photon ring.'' In the Kerr spacetime, this image structure arises from strong gravitational lensing near the black hole that results in a series of increasingly demagnified images of each emitting region that exponentially converge to a limiting critical curve. Exotic black hole alternatives, such as wormholes, can introduce additional photon rings. Hence, precisely characterizing multi-ring images is a promising pathway for measuring black hole parameters, such as spin, as well as exploring non-Kerr spacetimes. Here, we examine the interferometric response of multi-ring systems using a series of 1) simple geometric toy models, 2) synthetic BHEX and EHT observations of geometric models, and 3) semi-analytic accretion models with ray-tracing in the Kerr spacetime. We find that interferometric amplitude is more sensitive to the shape of the photon ring, while interferometric phase is more sensitive to its displacement, which is most sensitive to black hole spin. We find that for models similar to Messier 87* (M87*), the relative displacement of the first strongly lensed image from the weakly lensed direct image is approximately $1\,μ{\rm as}$ per unit dimensionless spin, yielding an expected phase signature on a 25 G$λ$ baseline of $\sim44^\circ$ per unit spin.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Roman N. Burridge, Geoffrey C. Bower</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of black hole mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond SgrA* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Himanshu Verma, Priyanka Sarmah, Joseph Silk, Kingman Cheung</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The resolution of photon rings of Sgr~A$^*$ and M87 is the next milestone of upcoming EHT-like interferometries. We extend the formalism developed in our previous work~\cite{Verma:2023hes} to constrain primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter using microlensing-induced distortions of black hole shadows. Building upon the theoretical framework for microlensing of photon rings, we apply this methodology to both Sgr A* and M87, considering multiple PBH populations: (i) PBH dark matter spikes around central supermassive black holes, (ii) NFW halo contributions in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, and (iii) foreground Milky Way PBH dark matter affecting M87* observations. The microlensing signal manifests as a time-dependent asymmetry and deformation of the photon ring, providing the most sensitive observable for lensing effects. We assess the detectability of these signatures with future EHT-like interferometers. Our analysis reveals that M87* provides the strongest constraints on PBH dark matter. We show that the absence of photon-ring asymmetries in observations with angular resolution of order $0.1\,μ{\rm as}$ can constrain PBHs in the mass range $10^{-5}\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, with maximal sensitivity near $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{3}\,M_\odot$, for PBH dark matter fractions as small as $f_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-2}$.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$α$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Alejandro Cruz-Osorio, Claudio Meringolo, Christian M. Fromm, Yosuke Mizuno, Sergio Servidio, Antonios Nathanail, Ziri Younsi, Luciano Rezzolla</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">M. Baran Ökten</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae. This provides a precious clue to the nature of the progenitor of this peculiar GRB, which could also be present in other bursts that feature a long quiescence followed by a bright emission episode with a hard spectrum.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in soft X-ray, optical and radio bands, but rarely in gamma-ray band. Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The long GRB 180728A, at a redshift of $z = 0.1171$, stands out due to its high isotropic energy of $E_{γ,iso} \sim 2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, in contrast with most events at redshift $z<0.2$. We analyze the properties of GRB 180728A's prompt emission, afterglow, and associated supernova SN 2018fip, comparing them with other GRB-SN events. This study employs a dense photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the afterglow and the SN up to 80 days after the burst, supported by image subtraction to remove the presence of a nearby bright star, and modelling of both the afterglow and the supernova. GRB 180728A lies on the $E_{p,i}-E_{γ,iso}$ plane occupied by classical collapsar events, and the prompt emission is one of the most energetic at $z < 0.2$ after GRB 030329 and GRB 221009A. The afterglow of GRB 180728A is less luminous than that of most long GRBs, showing a shallow early phase that steepens around 5 hours (0.2 days). The GRB exploded in an irregular, low-mass, blue, star-forming galaxy, typical of low-z collapsar events. Because of the relatively faint afterglow, the light curve bump of SN 2018fip dominates the optical emission already after $\sim$3 days and is one of the best sampled to date. The strong suppression below $\sim$ 4000 angstrom and a largely featureless continuum in the early 6--9 days spectra favor aspherical two-component ejecta with a high-velocity collimated component ($> 20,000 km s^{-1}$), dominant early-on, and a more massive, low-velocity component, which dominates at much later epochs. Our findings indicate that asymmetries need to be considered in order to better understand GRB-SNe. In any case, SN 2018fip shares many characteristics with typical GRB-SNe. Its kinetic energy is below the common range of $10^{52}-10^{53}$ erg and does not correlate with the high energy of the GRB, highlighting the diversity of the GRB-SN energy budget partition.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Tomoki Wada, Shigeo S. Kimura</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the gamma-ray spectrum in the MeV range arising from electron-positron pair annihilation in fireballs associated with magnetar giant flares (MGFs), motivated by the recent observation of a MeV gamma-ray line feature in a bright gamma-ray burst, GRB~221009A. We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened, power-law spectral feature with photon index -1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron-positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGFs could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect O(100) photons from such events.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Xueying Shao, He Gao</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $σ_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $α$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $α\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $σ_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $σ_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B < 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">T. Mondal, S. Chakraborty, L. Resmi, D. Bose</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Edilberto Aguilar-Ruiz, Ramandeep Gill, Paz Beniamini, Jonathan Granot</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The detection of a very-high-energy TeV spectral component in the afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has opened a new probe into the energetics of ultra-relativistic blast waves and the nature of the circumburst environment in which they propagate. The afterglow emission is well understood as the synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons in the medium swept up by the blast wave. The same distribution of electrons also inverse-Compton upscatters the softer synchrotron photons to produce the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) TeV emission. Accurate modeling of this component generally requires a computationally expensive numerical treatment, which makes it impractical when fitting to observations using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Simpler analytical formalisms are often limited to broken power-law solutions and some predict an artificially high Compton-Y parameter. Here we present a semi-analytic framework for a spherical blast wave that accounts for adiabatic cooling and expansion, photon escape, and equal-arrival-time-surface integration, in addition to Klein-Nishina effects. Our treatment produces the broadband afterglow spectrum and its temporal evolution at par with results obtained from more sophisticated kinetic calculations. We fit our model to the afterglow observations of the TeV bright GRB\,190114C using MCMC, and find an energetic blast wave with kinetic energy $E_{k, \rm iso} = 9.1^{+7.41}_{-3.13} \times 10^{54} \, \rm erg$ propagating inside a radially stratified external medium with number density $n(r)\propto r^{-k}$ and $k=1.67^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Recent detections of very-high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 100$~GeV) emission from GRB afterglows, notably the unprecedented brightness of GRB~221009A observed by LHAASO, reveal emission components beyond the standard electron synchrotron model. Multi-TeV photons motivate synchrotron self-Compton and possibly hadronic contributions, while the non-detection of coincident neutrinos by IceCube/KM3NeT/GRAND200k constrains the microphysical parameters, jet kinetic energy and ambient medium density. We model the VHE afterglow of GRB 221009A with an external forward shock from a Gaussian structured jet in a uniform density medium. This angular structure reproduces the extreme TeV output at an off-axis angle but without demanding large energies as in a top-hat jet. We also compute the corresponding $pγ$ neutrino flux in the PeV-EeV energies and derive a time-integrated upper limit based on the effective areas of IceCube Gen2 and GRAND200k, providing the contributions of individual GRBs to the neutrino events. The predicted neutrino flux for GRB 221009A with model parameters inferred from multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution lies below the sensitivities of these detectors. Even under highly optimistic microphysical conditions, our correlation analysis infers that the events from this GRB are of order $\sim 0.1$ for upcoming GRAND200k. We also compare neutrino fluxes for on-axis and off-axis viewing geometries and find that jet orientation alone can introduce nearly an order of magnitude variation in the signal. Thus, our studies imply that a GRB both brighter and closer than GRB 221009A would be crucial for any neutrino detections by upcoming neutrino telescopes. Future GRB detections by the CTA will provide important constraints on their geometry, radiation mechanisms, and any potential associated neutrino signals.</p>

  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23113v2">Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation under the Combined Effects of Axion-Like Particles and Lorentz Violation</a>
</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Longhua Qin, Jiancheng Wang, Chuyuan Yang, Huaizhen Li, Quangui Gao, Ju Ma, Ao Wang, Weiwei Na, Ming Zhou, Zunli Yuan, Chunxia Gu, Guangbo Long</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons.

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{aγ} = 1.685 \times 10^{-10},\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \times 10^{-8},\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the main targets for the observations of the MAGIC telescopes. As a result of the effort in improving the sensitivity of the instrument and the automatic follow-up strategy, MAGIC detected two GRBs in the very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) range, namely GRB 190114C and GRB 201216C. In GRB 190114C ($z=0.42$), the data collected by MAGIC revealed a new emission component at sub-TeV energies in the afterglow of the GRB. The very rich multi-wavelength dataset, spanning 17 orders of magnitude in energy, allowed to perform a detailed modelling of the broadband emission. The multi-wavelength data could be modelled within a one-zone synchrotron-self Compton scenario with internal $γ-γ$ absorption, where the model parameters are compatible with those found in previous GRB afterglow studies below GeV energies. Similarly, GRB 201216C broadband emission could be explained using the same model, although the amount of simultaneous multi-wavelength data is reduced with respect to GRB 190114C. In particular, GRB 201216C challenged the current MAGIC detection potential, as its redshift was determined to be $z=1.1$, strongly reducing the observed gamma-ray flux but making it the most distant source detected at VHE. These two detections, accompanied by evidence of VHE emission from a few more GRBs, opened up new questions such as the presence of sub-TeV emission in different classes and phases of GRBs. In this contribution we will present the status of the MAGIC GRB follow-up program, with an highlight on its detected GRBs. Moreover we will show the results on the GRBs observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019 with no evidence of VHE emission, in particular for those with simultaneous X-ray observations and redshift $z<2$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from explosions at cosmological distances, generating collimated jets. GRB 221009A, exploded on 9 October 2022, has been established as the brightest GRB to date. Its bright and long emission was extensively followed up from radio to gamma rays. LHAASO firmly detected the onset of the afterglow emission at energies up to $\sim$13 TeV within about an hour after the burst, starting just a few minutes after the trigger. While this VHE emission component can be accounted for in a narrow jet scenario, such an interpretation cannot reproduce the broadband emission observed at later times, which exceeds the theoretical expectations. This discrepancy can be settled if more complex models are considered, providing the first strong evidence for a structured jet in a long GRB. Unfortunately, the VHE emission after a few hours is poorly constrained, as sensitive VHE observations by Cherenkov Telescopes were prevented due to strong moonlight conditions. The first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory began observations about one day after the burst under high night sky background conditions. These observations are the first ones performed on GRB 221009A by a Cherenkov telescope, revealing a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$σ$ during the observations performed at 1.3 days after the burst. The monitoring campaign continued until the end of November 2022, making it the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with the LST-1.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) will enable sub-percent measurements of massive black hole parameters and provide access to the demographics of compact objects in galactic nuclei.

We perform hierarchical Bayesian inference on simulated EMRI catalogues to assess how well LISA could constrain the astrophysical population using parametrised population models.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">A. Wójtowicz, N. Vale Asari, Ł. Stawarz, G. Stasinska, D. Kozieł-Wierzbowska</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Aims. We investigate the radio loudness ($\mathcal{R}$) distribution in a large, homogeneous sample of radio galaxies. Methods. The sample is composed of galaxies from the ROGUE I/II catalogue belonging to the SDSS MGS and is divided into optically inactive radio galaxies (OPIRGs), optically active ones (OPARGs) and radio Seyferts. We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($λ$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z < 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\mathcal{R}$. The highest $\mathcal{R}$ values are associated with extended radio structures. $\mathcal{R}$ is anti-correlated with $λ$, and spans about 2 dex at fixed $λ$. Radio Seyferts, OPARGs and OPIRGs form a sequence of increasing $M_{BH}$ with substantial overlap. Radio Seyferts show no $\mathcal{R}$-$M_{BH}$ correlation, whereas OPARGs and OPIRGs show a weak positive trend. From theoretical considerations, the observed two-dex spread in radio luminosity and $\mathcal{R}$ can be reproduced by a four-fold variation in the dimensionless magnetic flux $\varphi$ assuming realistic black-hole spins. Conclusions. The smooth distribution of radio loudness supports a common evolutionary path for all radio sources, with black-hole spin and magnetic field varying continuously. The radio loudness depends on black-hole mass and accretion rate, while moderate variations in $\varphi$ may account for the observed scatter in this relation.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Extreme synchrotron blazars, characterized by a first peak in their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at frequencies exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz, often exhibit a second peak beyond 1~TeV. These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$σ$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $γ$-ray emitting HBLs.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Piotr Płonka, Agnieszka Janiuk</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not. We argue that self-gravity can potentially explain certain prompt emission properties due to the jet quenching.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Takuya Katagiri, Vitor Cardoso</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the geometry of a tidally deformed, rotating black hole and timelike geodesics in its vicinity. Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Gaia Alerts system is providing alerts on a variety of objects displaying a significant photometric change detected by the Gaia satellite from one passage to the next one over the same region of the sky. Among the over 22000 alerts published until the end of 2022, around 13 percent concern AGN or quasar candidates. We have embarked on a spectroscopic ground-based follow-up of some of those (including some selected by a different method specifically in galactic nuclei), to establish their true nature, and reveal the various phenomena leading to a change in magnitude of those AGN. The present paper deals with radio-quiet objects, while the radio-loud ones will be described in a companion paper. We confirm, on one hand, the AGN/quasar nature of 64 new candidates alerted by Gaia, and, on the other hand, obtained second-epoch spectra of over 200 known AGN also alerted for large photometric variations. The observed phenomena show a large variety: from Flares to Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) and a large number of Changing Look Quasars (CLQs, 56 secure ones, plus 23 probable ones), not forgetting some rarer events like SNe, microlensing events or Extreme Coronal Line Emitters. This sample shows that variability is an excellent tool to detect new quasars, especially radio-quiet ones that otherwise would be undetected, and that a significant fraction of variable AGN/quasars, around 10 percent, presents the CLQ phenomenon. Some of the new CLQs are followed-up to monitor further changes and measure time scales.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Sajad Ahanger, Shah Zahir, Sunder Sahayanathan, Naseer Iqbal, Zahoor Malik, Aaqib Manzoor</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of the blazar S5\,1044+71 using multi-wavelength data obtained from the \emph{Fermi}-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT telescopes. Applying the Bayesian block algorithm to the 3-day binned $γ$-ray lightcurve, we identify pronounced variability, including four major outbursts marked by significant flux enhancements. The highest flux recorded was $(1.1 \pm 0.2)\times 10^{-6}\,\text{ph}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ on 57868.5 MJD. Each outburst comprises multiple components, and lightcurve profile analysis indicates predominantly symmetric temporal structures. The shortest variability timescale of 4.5 hours constrains the emission region to be located within 0.03 pc of the central engine, likely near the broad-line region (BLR). Additionally, two highest-energy photons were detected with energies of 46.4 GeV (on 57739.6 MJD) and 42.5 GeV (on 59161.9 MJD), observed outside the peak flaring activity. The fractional variability shows an overall increasing trend from UV/optical to $γ$-ray bands, with a noticeable dip in the X-ray range, consistent with the shape of the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). The flux distributions during flares exhibit log-normal or double log-normal behavior, suggesting multiplicative variability processes and evolving emission zones. Cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the $γ$-ray and X-ray bands, with X-rays lagging by 42.5 days. Broadband SED modeling across different flux states supports a one-zone leptonic scenario, with $γ$-ray emission produced via external Compton scattering of IR and BLR photons. High-flux states show harder electron spectra, elevated break energies, and reduced magnetic fields-features consistent with efficient particle acceleration and Compton dominance.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Returning radiation is thought to play a key role in disk illumination of black hole X-ray binaries in the high-soft state, yet it has not been fully incorporated into XSPEC reflection models. We present a new table model for reflection spectroscopy that, for the first time, self-consistently accounts for the returning radiation. To isolate this effect, we adopt the standard disk-corona configuration but disable the corona, allowing the reflection spectrum to be produced solely by self-irradiation of the disk. Applying our model to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630$-$47, we report a rapidly spinning black hole ($a_* \sim 0.99$), a disk inclination of $i \sim 53^\circ$, a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm BH} \sim 15\% \, {\rm \dot{M}_{Edd}}$, and an electron density of $n_{\rm e} \sim 10^{21} \,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ to reproduce the observed reflection features. The model also yields a source distance of $D\sim 8.2 \, {\rm kpc}$, slightly below the commonly adopted value of $10 \, {\rm kpc}$ in the literature. Compared to the widely used relxillNS, our model naturally produces a harder high-energy reflection spectrum, fitting the data without invoking a Comptonized component.</p>

SN~2023zcu exhibits a well-sampled light curve covering the rise, plateau, and nebular phases. It has an optically thick phase of $100.6 \pm 0.6$ d with a magnitude drop of $\sim$1.7 mag in the {\em V} band during the transition between the plateau and the nebular phases. Weak emission features in the early-time spectra indicate a low-level interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. The spectral evolution is well sampled and exhibits a prominent P-Cygni profile of H$α$, a defining characteristic of Type IIP SNe. Signatures of metal-line formation (e.g., \ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{Ca}{2} near-infrared triplet) are also evident in the spectra as the SN evolves. Spectral modeling with the radiative-transfer code \texttt{TARDIS} during the early photospheric phase (8.7--35.5 d since explosion) yields photospheric temperatures decreasing from $\sim$9,000 to $\sim$6,000 K and expansion velocities declining from $\sim$10,000 to $\sim$5,400 km s$^{-1}$. A tailored expanding photosphere method (EPM) fit based on the \texttt{TARDIS} models provides a distance estimate of $27.8 \pm 2.0$ Mpc. Nebular-phase spectra and bolometric light-curve modeling suggest a progenitor mass in the range 12--15 M$_\odot$.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">NGC 4395 is a nearby dwarf spiral galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH, $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{4-5}\,M_\odot$). Recent optical continuum reverberation mapping studies have suggested potential lag variations between different epochs, offering important clues to the physical mechanisms governing variability in the vicinity of the central black hole. We present continuous intranight multi-band photometric monitoring of NGC 4395 based on three nights of observations with the Faulkes Telescope North and two nights with the Mephisto telescope. This represents the first systematic investigation of optical continuum lag stability in a robustly confirmed IMBH. By applying difference-imaging techniques to both the new observations and archival data, we significantly detect the optical inter-band lags of $\sim$5-15 minutes, which increase monotonically with wavelength. No obvious $u$-band lag excess is observed, implying a negligible fractional contribution from diffuse continuum (DC) emission to the optical continuum, in agreement with our spectral decomposition results. Remarkably, the inter-band lags remain stable over multi-year baselines. We attribute this long-term lag stability primarily to the minor DC contribution, a relatively steady disk-corona structure, and the unusually high X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio characteristic of low-luminosity AGNs, which likely allows X-ray reprocessing to dominate over other potential variability mechanisms. Future facilities like Gemini/SCORPIO, with its simultaneous optical-to-near-infrared coverage, will be ideally suited to play an important role in advancing this field.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Accretion onto black holes often leads to the launch of outflows that significantly influence their surrounding environments. The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona. Our findings provide new observational constraints on jet and wind formation in X-ray binaries and offer a fresh perspective on the interplay between different modes of accretion-driven feedback.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">IGR J17091-3624 is a distinctive black hole X-ray binary exhibiting exotic variability, including complex "heartbeat" oscillations in its X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in GRS 1915+105, a system renowned for its structured, rapid X-ray variability but heavily obscured at optical wavelengths. In contrast, IGR J17091-3624 is less obscured, making it a more accessible target for optical investigations. Due to its weak radio emission, optical and infrared data are essential to probe the jet and outer disc behavior of IGR J17091-3624. This study presents the first long-term optical monitoring of IGR J17091-3624, using data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) over its 2011, 2016, and 2022 outbursts. We combine these observations with quasi-simultaneous X-ray data from Swift/XRT, RXTE, and NICER, employing light curve and variability analysis, spectral energy distributions, color-magnitude diagrams, and optical/X-ray correlations to investigate optical emission mechanisms. We find that the optical and X-ray fluxes are significantly correlated, following a power-law relation with the index 0.40\pm0.04, suggesting that the optical emission in IGR J17091-3624 is dominated by an X-ray-irradiated accretion disk. Based on optical spectral slope constraints, we estimate the extinction toward IGR J17091-3624 A_V = 4.3 to 6.6 mag. The global optical/X-ray correlation suggests a distance estimate of 8-17 kpc, in line with previous findings. High-cadence optical observations show tentative evidence of optical oscillations that may arise from reprocessed X-ray modulations, although confirming this will require higher time-resolution optical data.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Abdurakhmon Nosirov, Cosimo Bambi, Leda Gao, Jos de Bruijne, Jiachen Jiang, Andrea Santangelo, Fu-Guo Xie</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Theoretical models predict that the Galaxy hosts $10^8$-$10^9$ black holes formed from the complete gravitational collapse of heavy stars and that most of these black holes are isolated, without any companion. Within 15 pc of the Solar System ($\sim 50$ ly), there may be a few black holes. If located inside one of the Local Interstellar Clouds - which occupy 5-20% of this local volume - an isolated black hole could produce detectable electromagnetic emission via accretion from the interstellar medium, given the capabilities of current or near-future observatories. However, precise predictions remain challenging due to large uncertainties in the expected accretion spectra. Outside these clouds, the accretion rate would be too low in any standard model to yield a detectable electromagnetic signal. While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.</p>

While astrometric detection via gravitational perturbation of nearby stars is conceivable, the local stellar density is too low for this method to be realistically successful. We have searched the Gaia DR3 catalog for candidate isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium and identified five sources. All candidates lie close to the Galactic plane, making them likely spurious astrometric solutions, for instance caused by unmodelled background sources (crowding) and/or unmodelled binarity; nevertheless, they cannot be definitively ruled out without follow-up observations.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Noam Soker</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">I examine a recently proposed failed-supernova scenario for the fading of the yellow supergiant event M31-2014-DS1, and find that it requires unlikely fine-tuned parameters to work, if at all. In the failed-supernova scenario, most of the yellow supergiant collapsed to form a black hole. Due to the energy carried by neutrinos from the cooling, collapsing core, gravity decreases, leading to the ejection of a small fraction of the outer envelope, some of which remains bound. The fallback accreted gas possesses large angular-momentum fluctuations due to the pre-collapse envelope convection. The fallback material forms intermittent accretion disks around the black hole that launch jets (or disk wind), which unbind most of the bound material. The failed-supernova scenario for M31-2014-DS1 requires that only <1% of the bound material be accreted by the black hole, but the jets do not shut down the backflow for over 10 years. I find this fine-tuned requirement unlikely. I also find that, due to the rapid radiative cooling of the outflow interaction zone with the outer gas, the expected radiation is about an order of magnitude or more above the observed value. These, as well as earlier challenges raised against the failed-supernova scenario, make the alternative type II intermediate-luminosity optical transient scenario, in which fading is due to dust ejection in a violent binary interaction, more likely. The fading event M31-2014-DS1 does not support the failed-supernova scenario predicted by the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Andrew Mummery</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Tidal disruption events (TDEs) represent a truly unique, and potentially very powerful, probe of the quiescent supermassive black hole (SMBH) population. Given current observational survey capabilities the vast majority of the TDEs discovered in the next decade will be observed only across optical-UV wavelengths. A set of questions of broad scientific interest relating to SMBH demographics and SMBH-galaxy correlations could in principal be answered by using TDE emission as an efficient means to constrain SMBH masses. In this paper we argue for using well-understood elements of TDE emission (the thermal X-ray continuum and late-time UV plateau) to derive empirical relationships between the more poorly understood early optical/UV flare and the black hole mass, before using these empirical relationships to measure TDE black hole masses simply and rapidly. We provide a publicly available code TDEFLARE which does this, showing (i) it produces results consistent with disk codes containing far more physics, (ii) it reproduces galactic scaling relationships at high ($>5σ$) significance, (iii) it produces reliable mass estimates for both partial and full disruptions, and (iv) it does not require late time data to derive mass constraints. We provide 89 TDE black hole mass constraints, derive the intrinsic black hole mass function implied by the current TDE population, and discuss the Malmquist-Hills bias, an important confounding factor in TDE science.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $γ$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $γ$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission.

The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\mathcal{F}_{-5}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\,σ$) of about $2.5\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Galactic Be star binary MWC 656 was long considered the only known Be star + black hole (BH) system, making it a critical benchmark for models of massive binary evolution and for the expected X-ray emission of Be+BH binaries. However, recent dynamical measurements cast doubt on the presence of a BH companion. We present new multi-epoch ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), combined with high-resolution optical spectra, to reassess the nature of the companion. The far-ultraviolet spectra reveal high-ionisation features, including prominent N V and He II lines, which are absent in the spectra of normal Be stars and are indicative of a hot, luminous companion. Spectral modelling shows that these features cannot originate from the Be star or from an accretion disc around a compact object. Instead, we find that the data are best explained by a hot ($T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 85$ kK), compact, hydrogen-deficient star with strong wind signatures, consistent with an intermediate-mass stripped star. Our revised orbital solution and composite spectroscopic modelling yield a companion mass of $M_2 = 1.54^{+0.57}_{-0.46}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, definitively ruling out a BH and disfavouring a white dwarf. MWC 656 thus joins the growing class of Be + stripped star binaries. The system's unusual properties - including a high companion temperature and wind strength - extend the known parameter space of such binaries.

We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Jennifer Stafford, Sebastian Heinz, Mateusz Ruszkowski, Torsten Enßlin, Yi-Hao Chen</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Conduction as a mechanism for explaining the disrupted cooling-flow in galaxy clusters has been mostly discounted, as the process is inefficient at transporting heat all the way from the cluster into the core. However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $η$ can reach up to 50\% of the maximum possible efficiency $η_{\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $η\approx f_{\rm sp}η_{\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\rm sp} \lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.</p>

We find that the heat pump efficiency $η$ can reach up to 50\% of the maximum possible efficiency $η_{\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $η\approx f_{\rm sp}η_{\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\rm sp} \lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Murray Brightman, Joahan Castañeda Jaimes, Daniel Stern, Brian Grefenstette</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours. An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3<Γ<0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The properties of these NuSTAR FXTs most resemble low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and would be much more common than their higher-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Fabio Pacucci, Andrea Ferrara, Dale D. Kocevski</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The discovery by JWST of a substantial population of compact "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) presents a major puzzle: their observed spectra defy standard astrophysical interpretations. Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($>100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that JWST is witnessing the widespread formation of heavy black hole seeds in the early Universe.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Luca Sciarini, Sophie Rosu, Sylvia Ekström, Maxime Marchand, Patrick Eggenberger, Georges Meynet</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">One of the largest source of uncertainties in the predictions of stellar models comes from the internal transport mechanisms. In close massive binaries, previous theoretical studies suggest that tides systematically boost chemical mixing. However, observations do not reveal any clear period-nitrogen enrichment trend, challenging these predictions. In addition, comprehensive examinations of the interplay between tidal interactions, angular momentum and chemicals transport have so far been scarce. We investigate the interplay between tidal interactions and rotational mixing, and the impact of the angular moment transport (AMT) assumptions. We examine whether tidal interactions enhance or suppress chemical mixing by computing grids of genec binary models with various AMT treatments. In order to independently assess the role of tidal interactions, we systematically compute model variations of single stars with identical initial conditions. Our investigations reveal that tides can either enhance or suppress mixing relative to single-star models, and that the outcome is highly sensitive to the AMT assumptions. We identify a key contrast between the two types of computed models: in close systems subject to tides, magnetic models predict that the mixing efficiency is mostly determined by the orbital configuration, whereas in hydrodynamic models it also depends on the assumed initial velocity. As a result, hydro models may display non-monotonic period-enrichment trends, or even period-enrichment correlations. These results highlight the importance of the AMT assumptions in modeling binaries with tidal interactions. The sensitivity of the predictions of hydro models to initial conditions extends the size of the period-enrichment parameter space they cover, allowing them to accommodate for peculiar observed systems, i.e., with mild enrichment at short periods, or high enrichment at longer periods.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae. This provides a precious clue to the nature of the progenitor of this peculiar GRB, which could also be present in other bursts that feature a long quiescence followed by a bright emission episode with a hard spectrum.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We construct posterior distributions of the equation of state (EoS) for matter beyond the inner crust of neutron stars by incorporating finite nuclei (FN) constraints within relativistic mean field models.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Compact object mergers are multi-messenger sources and progenitors of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), primarily understood by gamma-ray observations, while poorly constrained in the prompt low-energy phase. A long-lasting X-ray emission was discussed as afterglows following several short-duration ($\lesssim$2 s) bursts, yet this prompt X-ray component was not directly observed or confirmed. Here we report the discovery of a minutes-long ($\sim$560 s) flash of soft X-rays immediately following the short ($\sim$0.4 s) GRB 250704B. The long-soft bump points to a distinct phase of prompt emission in X-rays detected by Einstein Probe in an event that otherwise appear as an ordinary short GRB, showing that long-lasting X-ray emission is likely a common feature of merger-driven bursts and a promising electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational-wave sources.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Compact object mergers are multi-messenger sources and progenitors of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), primarily understood by gamma-ray observations, while poorly constrained in the prompt low-energy phase. A long-lasting X-ray emission was discussed as afterglows following several short-duration ($\lesssim$2 s) bursts, yet this prompt X-ray component was not directly observed or confirmed. Here we report the discovery of a minutes-long ($\sim$560 s) flash of soft X-rays immediately following the short ($\sim$0.4 s) GRB 250704B. The long-soft bump points to a distinct phase of prompt emission in X-rays detected by Einstein Probe in an event that otherwise appear as an ordinary short GRB, showing that long-lasting X-ray emission is likely a common feature of merger-driven bursts and a promising electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational-wave sources.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Orhan Donmez, Sushant G. Ghosh, M. Yousaf, G. Mustafa, Farruh Atamurotov</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate accretion disk dynamics and the formation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the infrared limit around Kerr-like black holes in asymptotically safe gravity. Relativistic hydrodynamic solutions of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion reveal that quantum corrections significantly modify the structure of the shock cone formed around the black hole. The black hole spin controls the asymmetric of the shock cone through frame-dragging effects, whereas the quantum correction parameter softens the effective gravitational potential, resulting in a wider shock opening angle, weaker post-shock compression, and reduced density concentration within the cone. Time-dependent mass accretion rates reveal oscillation modes trapped within the shock cone. The power spectral density (PSD) investigations suggest that these modes naturally generate low-frequency QPOs, whose amplitudes, coherence, and harmonic structure depend on both the spin and the quantum correction parameter. The PSD analyses performed at different radial locations reveal that identical QPO frequencies are obtained in all cases. The numerically detected frequencies result from the excitation of global oscillation modes trapped within the post-shock region. The resulting global modes are found to consist of fundamental frequencies, their associated harmonic overtones, and near-commensurate frequency ratios such as 2:1 and 3:2. Coherent oscillations are enhanced and near-commensurate frequency ratios are produced when moderate rotation and moderate quantum corrections are coupled. Large quantum correction parameters, on the other hand, wash out unique spectral peaks and suppress oscillation amplitudes.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">An-Chieh Hsu, Tetsuya Hashimoto, Tomotsugu Goto, Tomoki Wada, Bjorn Jasper Raquel</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Satoshi Takashima, Hirokazu Odaka, Ryota Tomaru, Atsushi Tanimoto, Aya Bamba, Toru Tamagawa</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The luminous accreting pulsar SMC X-1 is an appropriate target to explore the accretion dynamics. SMC X-1 shows unique quasi-periodic flux variability of 40-65$\,$days known as superorbital modulation. To constrain the accretion structure of SMC X-1 based on timing and spectral study, we have analysed X-ray data of SMC X-1 observed by Suzaku and NuSTAR at various epochs between 2011 and 2022. The spectral analysis shows that the hydrogen column density ($N_\mathrm{H}$) increases from $1.1 \times 10^{22}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ to $1.24 \times 10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ as the flux decreases with the superorbital modulation. The neutral iron K$α$ line at 6.4$\,$keV has a broad width of 0.3$\,$keV, and its equivalent width increases as toward superorbital low states. The line broadening is consistent with Keplerian motion at the inner disc rather than the stellar wind velocity of the donor star. These findings support that the superorbital modulation is a consequence of X-ray attenuation by the warped accretion disc. To test this interpretation, we have conducted photon transport simulations of a system consisting of a neutron star, a warped disc, and optically-thin disc atmosphere. Occultation of the central source by the disc successfully reproduces the observed variations in the equivalent width of neutral iron K$α$ line, pulse profiles, and flux in hard X-rays. Notably, a disc precession angle of approximately $30^\circ$ can account for the observational features. For the radiation pattern of the photon source, the preferred beam width corresponds to a standard deviation of $30^\circ$.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently reported compelling evidence for the presence of a gravitational-wave background signal. Mapping the gravitational-wave background is key to understanding how it is formed, since anisotropy is a tracer for, for example, a supermassive black hole binary origin. In this work we refine the frequentist regularised gravitational-wave mapping analysis developed in our previous work (as part of the MeerKAT PTA 4.5-year data release). We derive a point-spread function describing the angular resolution of a PTA. We investigate how the point spread function changes for different PTA constellations and determine the best possible angular resolution achievable within our framework. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that previous methods do not capture the actual resolution - especially in regions of the sky with a high density of pulsars. We propose an improved scheme that accounts for a variable local resolution and test it using realistic simulations of the latest MeerKAT dataset.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present the first systematic study of rigidly rotating protoquark stars based on isentropic equations of state (EOS) within the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) framework. Using a quasi-static equilibrium approach, we follow the Kelvin--Helmholtz evolution from hot, lepton-rich matter to a cold, catalyzed quark star. Rotation substantially enhances the maximum stable mass (by up to $\sim 40\%$), equatorial radius, and key rotational observables, with the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy, $T_{\rm kin}/|W|$, reaching $0.18$--$0.19$ near the Keplerian limit, indicating a heightened susceptibility to gravitational-wave--emitting instabilities. Thermal evolution introduces a clear ordering: all stellar properties peak during the lepton-rich stages and decrease monotonically as the star cools. Compared to hadronic stars, rotating protoquark stars exhibit larger radii, higher moments of inertia, and stronger quadrupolar deformation, producing a distinct signature in the mass--radius--spin plane that can accommodate objects such as HESS~J1731--347 and PSR~J0740+6620.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We report the third observation of the Seyfert-1.9 active galactic nucleus (AGN) MCG-05-23-16 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (\textit{IXPE}), together with optical spectro-polarimetry obtained at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and combined with archival near-ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared polarimetric data. No X-ray polarization was detected in the 2-8 keV band, with a 99\% confidence upper limit of $\leq$2.9\%, further reduced to $\leq$2.5\% when combined with the two past IXPE observations of the same target. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that equatorial coronal models are disfavored if the AGN is indeed a type-1.9/2 AGN, but coronae coplanar to the accretion disk remain consistent if the source is less inclined than previously assumed. \textit{VLT}/FORS2 data reveal a typical type-2 spectrum in total flux, a broad H$α$ line in polarized flux, and strongly wavelength dependent polarization degree and angle, rotating by nearly 70$^\circ$ across the optical band. Comparison with historical measurements confirms long-term stability of the polarization spectrum and a $\sim$90$^\circ$ rotation in the near-ultraviolet. Interpreting the multi-wavelength polarization relative to the AGN ionization axis indicates that the main obscurer is not a compact circumnuclear torus, but a distant kpc-scale dust lane crossing the galaxy. This result implies that MCG-05-23-16 is in fact a type-1 AGN seen through foreground dust. The low X-ray column density becomes consistent with the absence of polarization, provided that the nuclear inclination is low.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Siyuan Chen, Karan Jani, Thomas W. Kephart</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Black holes contain more entropy than any other component of the observable universe. Gravitational-wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have shown evidence of a previously unknown black hole mass range, which provides new information to update the entropy budget. Increases in entropy due to binary black hole mergers, as implied in the second law of thermodynamics, should also be added to the budget. In this study, we update the cosmological entropy budget for black holes in the stellar to lite-intermediate-mass range $(5-300~M_\odot)$, originating from either supernovae or binary mergers, by utilizing a suite of population synthesis models and phenomenological fits derived from numerical relativity. We report three new insights: Firstly, the cumulative entropy from merging black holes surpasses the total entropy from cosmic microwave background photons around the onset of the Over-massive Black Hole Galaxy phase at $z\sim 12$, suggesting that mergers played a more significant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe than relic radiation. Secondly, if primordial black holes constitute a nonzero fraction of dark matter, their early binary mergers establish an ``entropy floor" in the Dark Ages and can dominate the cumulative merger-generated entropy history even for small abundances. Thirdly, by computing the cosmological density parameters, we highlight the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where the production of gravitational-wave energy is inefficient compared to the immense generation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ashwin Aravindaraj, Hsiang-Kuang Chang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Correlations between gamma-ray and X-ray spectral properties of pulsars are investigated in order to provide observational hints on physics involved in pulsars' high-energy emissions. Using a sample of 43 pulsars detected in both X-ray and gamma-ray bands, we find that pulsars' gamma-ray luminosity, $L_γ$, clearly correlates with the luminosity of non-thermal X-ray emission, $L_{\rm p}$, and anti-correlates with non-thermal X-ray photon index. Other gamma-ray spectral parameters show weaker or negligible correlations. The found relation that $L_γ\propto L_{\rm p}^{0.49\pm 0.05}$ implies a certain connection between radiation mechanisms and energy distributions of radiating particles for these high-energy emissions. Pulsars with and without detected thermal emissions seem to show different dependencies in those correlations, suggesting the possible existence of two different kinds of pulsars. The ones without detected thermal emissions may represent a population of pulsars with low surface temperature. The origin and energetics of high-energy emitting electron-positron pairs for this group of pulsars probably do not depend on their surface thermal emissions, while that of the other group do. The low surface temperatures might be evidence for the working of some exotic processes of neutron-star cooling. Similar to $L_{\rm p}$, some tempting relationships are found among each gamma-ray spectral parameter, surface temperature and thermally radiating area radius. It again strengthens the connection between gamma-ray and X-ray emissions from pulsars.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Lucas M. Pasquevich, Gustavo E. Romero, Matías M. Reynoso</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are point-like sources that exhibit apparent X-ray luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass compact objects. A widely accepted interpretation is that these systems are X-ray binaries accreting matter possibly at super-Eddington rates. In this regime, photon trapping inflates the accretion disk, making it geometrically and optically thick. Radiation-driven winds launched from the supercritical disk form funnel-shaped walls along the symmetry axis. While the apparent X-ray luminosity can exceed the Eddington limit due to geometrical beaming within this funnel, a misalignment with the observer's line of sight strongly suppresses the X-ray emission, rendering the ULX electromagnetically obscured.
  This work explores the potential for high-energy neutrino production in black hole-hosting ULXs. We model proton acceleration via magnetic reconnection in the region above the super-accreting black hole. Although electromagnetic emission is efficiently absorbed by the dense wind and radiation fields, neutrinos generated from photomeson interactions can escape. Our model self-consistently accounts for energy losses of pions and muons in this environment. The results indicate that misaligned, electromagnetically obscured Galactic ULXs could produce a neutrino flux detectable by instruments like KM3NeT and IceCube within several years of observation.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Bao-An Li</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The trace anomaly of dense matter, $Δ\equiv 1/3 - P/\varepsilon$, defined in terms of the ratio of pressure $P$ to energy density $\varepsilon$, quantifies deviations from conformal symmetry and plays a central role in both the hydrodynamic response and gravitational equilibrium. While $Δ(\varepsilon)$ has recently been inferred from neutron star observations, we report the first Bayesian extraction of the trace anomaly from collective flow observables in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. By employing transport-model simulations that explicitly decouple the cold-matter mean-field potential from thermal effects, we directly constrain the cold dense-matter equation of state (EOS). Remarkably, the trace anomaly inferred from laboratory flow data agrees quantitatively, within $68\%$ credible intervals, with independent astrophysical posterior bands. This nontrivial agreement demonstrates that heavy-ion collisions and neutron star observations probe the same universal macroscopic properties of dense matter, establishing the trace anomaly as a composition-insensitive descriptor of dense matter across widely different physical environments.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present the longest and the densest quasi-simultaneous radio, X-ray and optical campaign of the black hole low mass X-ray binary GX339-4, covering five years of weekly GX339-4 monitoring with MeerKAT, Swift-XRT and MeerLICHT, respectively. Complementary high frequency radio data with the Australia Telescope Compact Array are presented to track in more detail the evolution of GX339-4 and its transient ejecta. During the five years, GX339-4 has been through two "hard-only" outbursts and two "full" outbursts, allowing us to densely sample the rise, quenching and re-activation of the compact jets. Strong radio flares were also observed close to the transition between the hard and the soft states. Following the radio flare, a transient optically thin ejection was spatially resolved during the 2020 outburst, and was observed for a month. We also discuss the radio/X-ray correlation of GX339-4 during this five year period, which covers several states in detail from the rising phase to the quiescent state. This campaign allowed us to follow ejection events and provide information on the jet proper motion and its intrinsic velocity.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">B. Thakore, M. Regis, M. Negro, S. Camera, D. Gruen, N. Fornengo, A. Roodman</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Our understanding of the $γ$-ray sky has greatly advanced, yet studying the unresolved $γ$-ray background (UGRB) can unveil the nature of the faintest $γ$-ray source populations in the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations between the UGRB and tracers of large-scale cosmic structure allow us to infer which sources contribute the most to this emission. In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $γ$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB. Intriguingly, the properties inferred for the sources contributing to the UGRB show departures from those of the resolved γ-ray population, suggesting that the faint end of the $γ$-ray sky is not a simple extrapolation of currently resolved sources.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Colin J. Burke, Priyamvada Natarajan</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Between the groundbreaking detections of stellar-mass black holes by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and JWST's revelation of a surprisingly abundant population of supermassive black holes, one crucial missing link remains: the elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). IMBHs represent a key phase in the hierarchical growth of black holes, yet they have persistently evaded detection. Traditional methods, effective for both actively accreting and quiescent black holes, have largely failed to uncover this hidden population. Here, we argue that novel observational strategies--particularly time-domain variability studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and tidal disruption events--provide a promising path forward. Finding IMBHs will resolve critical gaps in our understanding of black hole formation and the various mechanisms driving their subsequent growth. The upcoming Vera C.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Zachary Gelles, Andrew Chael, Eliot Quataert</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We analyze the polarization of optically thin, stationary, axisymmetric black hole jets at scales of order the light cylinder radius. Our work generalizes the face-on results of Gelles et al. (2025) to arbitrary viewing inclination. Due to a combination of geometry and relativistic aberration, the polarization of the jet is not left-right symmetric, and the degree of asymmetry can shed light on both the viewing angle and the plasma bulk Lorentz factor. We show that there is always a radius in the jet at which the polarization transitions from azimuthal to radial; this radius is different along the spine and limb of the jet. We propose metrics that can be used to constrain the black hole spin, inclination angle, and plasma Lorentz factor from these polarimetric signatures, and we discuss the impact of limb-brightening on these measurements. We anticipate that these polarimetric signatures can be studied with current or forthcoming data in M87, NGC 315, NGC 4261, Centaurus A, Cygnus A, and other systems. Observations of the polarization of the base of the counter-jet in higher inclination sources would provide a particularly promising probe of black hole spin.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Zeeshan Nazir, Sikandar Akbar, Zahir Shah, Athar A. Dar, Zahoor Malik</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS~0402$-$362 using \textit{Fermi}-LAT/Swift-XRT/UVOT observations spanning from MJD 54686-60321. The $γ$-ray light curve exhibits multiple phases of enhanced activity, with the fractional variability parameter ($F_{\mathrm{var}}$) showing larger amplitudes at longer timescales, consistent with variability trends observed in other FSRQs. Statistical analysis of the flux and spectral index distributions using the Anderson--Darling test and histogram fitting reveals that both distributions deviate from a single log-normal form and are better represented by a double log-normal profile, indicating two distinct flux states. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the $γ$-ray emission using the Lomb--Scargle periodogram identified a significant periodic signal at $\sim$413~days with a confidence level exceeding $3σ$. However the proximity of the timescale to one year and limited number of observed cycles prevents a definitive interpretation. Broadband spectral energy distributions for six flux states were modeled using a one-zone leptonic framework incorporating synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), and external Compton (EC) components. The SEDs are well reproduced with physically reasonable parameters: high-flux states exhibit harder electron spectra and lower magnetic field strengths ($B \sim 0.2--0.6\,\mathrm{G}$), while low-flux states show softer spectra and stronger magnetic fields ($B \sim 1.3\,\mathrm{G}$). The fitted break energy decreases during high-flux states, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling and a transition toward a particle- or kinetic-energy-dominated jet. These trends are consistent with the ``harder-when-brighter'' behavior commonly observed in blazars.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Emma L. Elley, James H. Matthews, Dipanjan Mukherjee, Bhargav Vaidya</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the impact of flickering variability in jet power on the luminosity and morphology of radio galaxies. We use a Lagrangian particle method together with relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the PLUTO code to track the evolution of electron spectra through particle acceleration at shocks and cooling processes. We introduce an adapted version of this method which improves tracking of adiabatic cooling in regimes where low density jet material mixes with high density from the ambient medium in the lobes. We find that rapid increases in jet power can lead to large increases in hotspot luminosity due to the interaction of a travelling shock structure with the pre-existing shock structure at the jet head. We show that in some cases it may be possible to identify a bright region of emission corresponding to a shock travelling along the jet axis. We find that the time-averaged radiative efficiency of variable jets is similar to their steady counterparts, but find significant departures from this on an instantaneous basis. We suggest that, together with environmental effects and differences in the average powers of jets, variable jet powers may have a significant impact on how we understand the diversity of radio jets seen in observations and have significant implications for interpretations of jet powers, energy budgets and luminosity-linear size diagrams.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Di Wang, Fa-Yin Wang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass -- lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The AT2017gfo kilonova transient remains a unique multi-messenger event thanks to its proximity (z=0.00987) and the possibility to investigate time-resolved spectra, providing evidence of r-process nucleosynthesis. The kilonova signal was extensively studied in the spectral and time domains, giving key insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of the ejecta. Here, we report the discovery of a novel correlation between two fundamental observables: the peak energy of the EF_E spectrum, Ep, and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity, Liso. In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV. Exploiting simulations from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, we demonstrate that our kilonova model inherently predicts this peculiar correlation, suggesting a new diagnostic tool for comparing observables against simulations. Future kilonova observations will provide additional insight into the physics behind the Ep-Liso correlation.</p>

In particular, we show that up to about 2.5 days after the merger, the AT2017gfo spectrum evolves according to: log10[Ep/eV] = -0.13 (+0.02/-0.02) + 0.62 (+0.02/-0.02) * log10[Liso/(1e41 erg/s)] (68% C.L.) while in subsequent epochs, Ep remains almost constant with Liso, flattening around 1 eV. Exploiting simulations from a state-of-the-art radiative transfer code, we demonstrate that our kilonova model inherently predicts this peculiar correlation, suggesting a new diagnostic tool for comparing observables against simulations. Future kilonova observations will provide additional insight into the physics behind the Ep-Liso correlation.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Jia-Shu Niu, Ying Zhang, Hui-Fang Xue</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We report the discovery of an exceptionally eccentric binary system, BE Lyncis (BE Lyn), which hosts the nearest known black hole (BH) to Earth. Through the analysis of $\textit{TESS}$ photometry combined with an extensive set of times of maximum light spanning 39 years, we identify BE Lyn as a high-amplitude $δ$ Scuti star in a binary with an orbital period of $\approx15.9$ years and an extraordinary orbital eccentricity of $e=0.9989^{+0.0008}_{-0.0021}$ ($>0.9968$ at 95% confidence) -- the highest reliably measured for any binary system. Dynamical constraints impose an upper limit on the orbital inclination of $i \lesssim 4.0^{\circ}$, corresponding to a companion mass of $M_2 \gtrsim 17.5~M_{\odot}$, which unequivocally favors a black hole. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, the formation of black holes via asymmetric supernovae, and the evolution of extreme binary systems. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the successful application of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating variable to unveil a dormant black hole, establishing a novel method for BH detection in non-interacting binaries.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yujun Yao, Luming Sun, Tao Wu, Ning Jiang, Shiyan Zhong, Xinwen Shu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Statistics on tidal disruption events (TDEs) may be contaminated by repeating TDEs (rTDEs), which have been extensively discovered recently. However, the origin of rTDEs remains unclear. In addition, no statistical research on rTDEs with time intervals $>5$ years has been made yet. In this work, we searched for rTDEs with time intervals of 5--19 years using CRTS data in a sample of 16 ZTF BTS TDEs at $z<0.05$. We found 2 rTDE candidates, AT 2019azh and AT 2024pvu, with time intervals of 13.2 and 17.1 years, respectively. The peak luminosities of CRTS flares are close to those of ZTF flares. For the CRTS flare of AT 2024pvu, using GALEX UV observations near the peak, we measured a blackbody temperature of $\sim19500$ K, consistent with TDEs and higher than SNe. Moreover, we estimated the expected number of SNe in the sample to be $\lesssim0.08$, and hence the probability that both CRTS flares are SNe is only 0.3\%. Therefore, the possibility that both CRTS flares are SNe can be ruled out, and it is likely that both are TDEs. Using the two rTDEs, we inferred that the TDE rate is 2--3 orders of magnitude higher than the average over 5--19 years prior to TDE detection. Considering another two rTDEs with intervals of $\sim$2 years in the sample and possible rTDEs missed by CRTS, rTDEs with intervals of $<20$ years may account for 25\%--60\% of the TDE sample. We prefer to explain rTDEs as repeating partial TDEs, but the possibility of independent TDEs cannot be ruled out and requires future observational tests.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar OP 313 is a high-redshift (z = 0.997) blazar that entered an intense gamma-ray active phase from November 2023 to March 2024, as observed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We present a multiwavelength analysis covering 15 years of data, from August 2008 to March 2024, to contextualize this period of extreme gamma-ray activity within the long-term emission of the source. We analyzed a long-term, comprehensive, multiwavelength dataset from different facilities and projects from radio to gamma-rays. We identified the 7 most intense gamma-ray flaring periods and performed a kinematic analysis of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data to determine whether new jet components emerged before or during these flares. For 2 of these flaring periods, we performed the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED). The VLBA-BU-BLAZAR and MOJAVE datasets reveal a new jet component appearing in both visibility datasets prior to the onset of one of the strongest gamma-ray flares. By comparing the timing of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR knots ejection with the gamma-ray flaring periods, we constrained the setup of the SED modeling. We also found that the first gamma-ray flaring period is less Compton-dominated than the others. Our results suggest that the recent activity of OP 313 is triggered by new jet components emerging from the core and interacting with a standing shock. The γ-ray emission likely arises from dusty torus photons upscattered via Inverse Compton (IC) by relativistic jet electrons. The SED modeling indicates that this component is less dominant during the first γ-ray flaring period than the later ones.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Simone Taioli, Francesca Triggiani, Stefano Simonucci</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The primordial 7Li abundance predicted by standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) exceeds that inferred from old, metal-poor stars by a factor of about 3-4. In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yi-Long Duan, Tuohuniyazi Tuniyazi, Gang Guo</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We study high-energy (HE) neutrino production from interactions between supernova (SN) ejecta and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), focusing on regular Type~II and Type~IIn SNe. Using observationally inferred CSM density distributions, we calculate the resulting neutrino fluxes and examine their dependence on key parameters, including the CSM density normalization $D_*$, outer radius $R_{\rm csm}$, proton acceleration efficiency $ε_p$, and magnetic energy fraction $ε_B$. Detection prospects are assessed with a binned likelihood analysis for IceCube, indicating that nearby SNe with moderately dense, confined CSM can produce detectable signals, with a typical detection horizon of $\sim 0.1$ - 1 Mpc. For a Galactic SN at $\sim 10$ kpc, high-statistics neutrino data with detailed temporal and spectral information can constrain $D_*$, $R_{\rm csm}$, and $ε_p$ to within a factor of $\sim 10$ or to a precision of $\sim 20\%$, depending on the assumed values of $D_*$ and $R_{\rm csm}$. These neutrino signals thus provide a complementary probe of the CSM profile and shock acceleration, alongside traditional electromagnetic observations.</p>

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We study high-energy (HE) neutrino production from interactions between supernova (SN) ejecta and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), focusing on regular Type~II and Type~IIn SNe. Using observationally inferred CSM density distributions, we calculate the resulting neutrino fluxes and examine their dependence on key parameters, including the CSM density normalization $D_*$, outer radius $R_{\rm csm}$, proton acceleration efficiency $ε_p$, and magnetic energy fraction $ε_B$. Detection prospects are assessed with a binned likelihood analysis for IceCube, indicating that nearby SNe with moderately dense, confined CSM can produce detectable signals, with a typical detection horizon of $\sim 0.1$ - 1 Mpc. For a Galactic SN at $\sim 10$ kpc, high-statistics neutrino data with detailed temporal and spectral information can constrain $D_*$, $R_{\rm csm}$, and $ε_p$ to within a factor of $\sim 10$ or to a precision of $\sim 20\%$, depending on the assumed values of $D_*$ and $R_{\rm csm}$. These neutrino signals thus provide a complementary probe of the CSM profile and shock acceleration, alongside traditional electromagnetic observations.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Chengjiang Yin, Zihao Lin, Jian-hua He</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We investigate the excitation of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in gravitational lensing by a Schwarzschild black hole using a scalar field model. By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Paul Disberg, Arash Bahramian, Ilya Mandel</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) have been proposed as evolutionary products of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) through a stage in which they are spider pulsars (i.e., redbacks and black widows). However, recent work has found that the systemic kicks of observed MSPs are significantly lower than the kicks of LMXBs and spiders, which appears to be in tension with this evolutionary model. We argue that this tension can be relieved, at least to some degree, by considering the fact that the observed MSPs are located at relatively short distances, whereas spider pulsars are located at greater distances and LMXBs are situated even further away. We model the distance-dependent kinematic bias for dynamically old objects, which favors observing objects that have received low kicks at short distances and correct the observed systemic kicks for this bias. We find that this kinematic bias can be big enough to close the gap between the MSP and LMXB kicks, although the spider pulsars appear to come from a slightly different systemic kick distribution, but this difference is not necessarily physical. All corrected systemic kick distributions are consistent with predictions from binary population synthesis for progenitor systems with a post-supernova orbital period of $P_{\text{orb}}\leq10\,$d and a companion mass of $M_{c}\leq1\,M_{\odot}$, where the natal kicks are calibrated to the velocities of young isolated pulsars. We conclude that the difference in observed systemic kicks is not necessarily in tension with a common origin for MSPs, spider pulsars, and LMXBs.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Wenjie Zhang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">In this Letter, we report the detection of soft X-ray time lags-i.e. variability in the softer photons lagging behind that in the harder photons-in seven XMM-Newton observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021ehb. We find correlated variability between the soft (0.3-0.7 keV) and hard (0.9-10 keV) bands on about 10^4 s time-scales, and measure a soft lag of about 500 s. This behaviour is broadly consistent with the disk-corona reverberation scenario established in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Together with the previously reported strong hard X-ray emission and broad Fe K line, our results suggest the presence of a compact corona and prominent relativistic disk reflection in AT2021ehb. The unusually high blackbody temperature (peaking at about 200 eV) is difficult to reconcile with thermal emission from a standard accretion disk around a about 10^7 Msun black hole, and may instead be analogous to the soft excess commonly observed in AGNs, whose physical origin remains debated. Finally, the measured lags offer a possible explanation for the rapid X-ray flux decline that occurred only three days after the peak, pointing to a scenario in which the corona cools following a sudden loss of the magnetic support required to sustain it.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Pei-Xin Zhu, Xiao-Ping Zheng, Quan Cheng, Chenghui Niu, Erbil Gügercinoğlu</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Pulsar glitches are generally viewed as stochastic events driven by sudden angular momentum transfer from the neutron star's superfluid interior to its crust. Except two peculiar pulsars with quasi-periodic glitches, this stochastic view has prevailed. Here, by clustering temporally proximate small glitches of the Crab pulsar, we uncover clear evidence of an underlying quasi-periodic modulation, challenging the paradigm of purely random behavior. Furthermore, our correlation analyses reveal a strong positive relationship between glitch cluster size and waiting time since the preceding clusters. These findings demonstrate the effect of angular momentum reservoir operating over long-term scales and enable the predictions of next glitching window. Remarkably, two minor glitches detected in July and August 2025, which align with our initial prediction made in June, should be confirmed as the onset of this predicted activity. Inspired by the initial success, we forecast the occurrence of a major glitch from now until August 2026, with possible glitch size up to a relative change in rotational frequency of $697.2 \times 10^{-9}$. Physically, the observed long-term quasi-periodicity and cluster size-waiting time correlations imply that each glitch event releases only a fraction of the stored superfluid angular momentum. This partial-release mechanism provides a unified framework for both stochastic and quasi-periodic glitch behaviors across different pulsars, underscoring the universality of the superfluid angular momentum reservoir effect. As the most intensively monitored object, the Crab pulsar serves as a natural laboratory for studying angular momentum inside neutron stars.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Intermediate polars are a class of cataclysmic variables in which a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star. The intermediate polar nature confirmation usually derives from the detection of two periods in both $X$-ray and optical photometry. In this respect, the high energy signal is often characterized by modulations on the white dwarf spin and the orbital period. However, noting that the periodograms may be characterized by strong features also at the synodic period and/or other sidebands, the timing analysis of the $X$-ray signal may offer the unique possibility to firmly discover an intermediate polar candidate. Here, we concentrate on a sample of five cataclysmic variable {binary} candidates: {i.e. SAXJ1748.2-2808, 1RXS J211336.1+542226, CXOGC J174622.7-285218, CXOGC J174517.4-290650, and V381 Vel, listed in the IPHome catalogue.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Coherent oscillations at kilohertz frequencies have recently been detected in a small number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), suggesting quasi-periodic dynamics in their central engines. A prominent example is GRB~230307A, which exhibited a brief, highly coherent, energy-dependent periodic signal interpreted as the possible spin signature of a nascent millisecond magnetar formed after a compact binary merger. Motivated by these developments, we conducted a comprehensive search for similar signals, accounting for both temporal and spectral dependencies, in 532 short GRBs with time-tagged event data recorded by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) onboard the \textit{Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory}. Within this sample, we identify a single statistically significant case: GRB~960616 (BATSE trigger~5502), in which the $\sim$30~ms main emission episode is coherently modulated at 1100~Hz, with the strongest modulation above 320~keV and a fractional amplitude of $\sim$47\%. Assuming the presence of a coherent periodic modulation, we use data-driven Monte Carlo simulations to place an upper limit of $\sim$8\% on the fraction of the total radiated energy that can be modulated by the QPO.

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A transient (LPA J0108+13) with repeated bursts was detected on the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope at a central frequency of 110.4 MHz in the direction of the radio galaxy 3C 33. The flux density of bursts ranges from tens to hundreds of Jy, and the duration of the bursts is \approx 1^m - 4^m. In daily observations, the total duration of which at the location of the transient exceeds 200 hours in the observation interval 2013-2025, 6 bursts were found. The nature of the source could not be determined. We believe that a new type of transients has been discovered.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Yuhe Zeng, Zhen Pan</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">A small body orbiting around an accreting massive object and periodically crossing its accretion disk is a common configuration in astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the secular evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass object (SMO), e.g., a star or a stellar-mass black hole (sBH), collides with the accretion disk of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), within a fully relativistic framework. We find (1) the disk always tends to align the SMO no matter what the initial orbital inclination $ι$ relative to the disk is, (2) the final orbital eccentricity of the SMO captured by the disk is always low though the orbital eccentricity may temporarily grow when the orbital inclination $ι$ is large and the SMO is an sBH, and (3) via collisions with the accretion disk only, only a small fraction of sBHs that are initially close to the SMBH and close to the disk can be captured by the disk within typical disk lifetime of active galactic nuclei. Two-body scatterings between SMOs in the nuclear stellar cluster play an essential role in randomly kicking sBHs towards the disk and boosting the capture rate.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The neutron-star X-ray source 1E 161348-5055, associated with the supernova remnant RCW 103, exhibits clear intensity variations with a period of 6.67 hr. To clarify the nature of this object and its long periodicity, detailed timing studies were applied to its archival X-ray data, taken with ASCA (in 1993), XMM-Newton (in 2001, 2005, and 2016), and NuSTAR (2016 and 2017). It was assumed that the 6.67 hr period arises due to the beat between the rotation and free precession periods of the star that is slightly aspherical. By removing timing perturbations to be caused by this long periodicity, the six data sets consistently yielded evidence for pulsations at periods of P~1.01 s, to be interpreted as the objects' spin period, although the optimum energy range differed among the data sets. The measured six periods accurately line up on a linear spin-down trend of dP/dt = 1.097x 10^{-12} s/s. The object is implied to have a characteristic age of 14.7 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4.2x10^{34} erg/s, which is insufficient to power the X-ray luminosity, a dipole magnetic field of ~4.6x10^{13} G, and a toroidal field of ~7 x10^{15} G. Its similarity and dissimilarity to magnetars are discussed. An emission geometry, which crudely explain these results, is presented.</p>

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ke Bian, Can-Min Deng</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of mysterious origin, with growing evidence linking at least some of them to magnetars. While FRBs are primarily observed in the radio band, their potential multi-wavelength afterglows remain largely unexplored. We investigate the possible afterglow of FRB 20171020A, a rare nearby and bright FRB localized in a galaxy at only 37 Mpc. Assuming that this source produces a future bright burst, we model the expected afterglow emission in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands under both uniform and wind-like ambient media, within the framework of the magnetar model. Our results show that the optical afterglow is the most promising for detection, but it fades rapidly and requires follow-up within a few hundred seconds post-burst.

These findings suggest that rapid optical follow-up offers the best opportunity to detect the afterglow of the next bright burst from FRB 20171020A, providing unique insights into the progenitor and its environment. To assess observational feasibility, we estimate the event rate of nearby FRBs with sufficient energy to power detectable afterglows, finding a rate of $\sim$0.3 per year for CHIME surveys.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Ke Bian, Can-Min Deng</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients with uncertain origins and environments. Recent studies suggest that some active FRBs may originate from compact objects in binary systems. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework to model the multi-wavelength afterglows of FRBs resided in binary systems and apply it to two representative repeaters, FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A. By solving the dynamics and radiation processes of FRB ejecta interacting with the surrounding medium, we compute afterglow light curves in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. Our results show that radio afterglows offer the best prospects for detection, with their brightness highly sensitive to ejecta kinetic energy and ambient density. Future high-sensitivity radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), could detect these signals. Optical afterglows, though short-lived and challenging to observe, may be significantly enhanced in dense environments, potentially making them detectable with facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In contrast, X-ray afterglows are predicted to be too faint for detection with current instruments.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">EP J171159.4-333253 is a new neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary discovered in outburst by the Einstein Probe (EP) on 2025 June 23, exhibiting clocked type-I X-ray bursts, eclipses and dips. In this paper, we report on the results of the X-ray spectral and timing analyses for EP J171159.4-333253 using data collected by EP and NuSTAR during the first 21 days of the outburst. The X-ray burst recurrence time can be characterized over a subset of nine bursts spanning 1.6 days around the NuSTAR observation, and the result is $t_{\rm rec}=8196 \pm 177\,$s with indications of a possible decreasing trend. From the X-ray eclipse events, the binary orbital period and the eclipse duration are estimated to be $P_{\rm orb}=6.48301 \pm 0.00003\,$hr and $D_{\star,X} = 1245.5^{+6.9}_{-6.5}\,$s, respectively. These enable an estimate of the mass and radius of the companion star and the binary inclination, which are $M_2\approx0.6-0.8\,M_\odot$, $R_2\approx0.7-0.8\,R_\odot$ and $i\approx73-75^\circ$, respectively. We also report on joint ULTRACAM and EP observations on 2025 July 21--22, detecting the source optical counterpart and covering an eclipse in both X-ray and optical bands. The optical eclipse is wavelength-dependent and broader than in X-rays, indicating that part of the optical emission arises from an extended region in the accretion flow. Despite a moderate variation in the source flux, the properties of the persistent X-ray emission are typical of a hard spectral state. We further evaluated the ratio of the accretion energy to the thermonuclear energy to be 120--130, implying helium bursts with the accreted hydrogen being depleted in-between bursts.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present Green's function solutions of the Newtonian time-dependent thin disk equations in the presence of outflows, showing that simple and exact analytical expressions exist in various natural limits of the problem. These Green's functions are mathematically very similar to the classical Lynden-Bell & Pringle solutions in the absence of outflows, but differ strongly in their precise physical details and observational implications. Solutions are presented for phenomenological radius-dependent outflows which both do and do not torque the local accretion flow, and for outflows which are launched proportional to the local accretion rate.

From spectropolarimetric analysis, the main contribution to the polarized radiation is due to Comptonized photons, but the polarization is higher than predicted in typical spreading layer geometries.

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Karina I. Caputi, Ryan A. Cooper, Pierluigi Rinaldi, Rafael Navarro-Carrera, Edoardo Iani</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 >~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 Msun. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta < 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H >~ 10^6 cm^{-3}) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^{+1.54}_{-0.79} x10^7 Msun and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^{+725}_{-310} Msun/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We have used Auriga -- a set of state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-size systems -- to study the impact of baryons on the Galactic subhalo population. A DM-only run counterpart of Auriga allows us to compare results with and without baryons. We repopulate the original suites with low-mass subhalos orders of magnitude lighter than the mass resolution limit, starting from a detailed characterization of Auriga data in the well-resolved subhalo mass range. The survival of low-mass subhalos to tidal forces is unclear and under debate nowadays, thus in our study we stay agnostic and consider two different levels of subhalo resilience to tidal stripping ('fragile' and 'resilient' subhalos). We find baryons to alter the Galactic substructure significantly, by decreasing its overall abundance by a factor $\sim2.4$ (fragile) and $\sim1.9$ (resilient) and subhalo concentration -- here defined in terms of maximum circular velocity -- by $\sim1.5$ with respect to the DM-only scenario. This has important consequences for indirect searches of DM. As an example, we investigated the case of using unidentified gamma-ray sources to set constraints on the DM particle properties, assuming some of them may be dark satellites. We find the DM annihilation cross-section constraints to worsen by a factor $\sim3.6$ in the most realistic scenario of including baryons, compared to DM-only simulations in the 'fragile' setup. Yet, a stronger resilience of subhalos to tidal stripping improves these DM limits by a factor $\sim4.5$ and $\sim10$ compared to the DM-only and hydrodynamical 'fragile' cases, respectively.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in supernovae, driven by neutrino-neutrino refraction, can catastrophically equilibrate flavors and potentially affect the neutrino-driven explosion.

By deriving exact analytical solutions for two-flavor evolution in red turbulent matter-where correlations grow as $t^{|ν|}$-we uncover a novel acceleration of coherence loss.

Translating our master-equation results into an effective damping rate for FFC linear analysis, we find that realistic red turbulence ($ν\sim -1$, fluctuation strength $ξ_ν\sim 0.1$) can elevate the FFC threshold by a factor of $\sim 3-5$, potentially stabilizing regions that would otherwise undergo explosion-killing flavor equilibration (or vice versa).

<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Neha Sharma, Aditya Vijaykumar, Prayush Kumar</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals is computationally intensive and typically requires millions of likelihood evaluations to construct posterior probability distributions. This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference.</p>

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">R. N. Li, Y. B. Wang, S. X. Yi, X. Zhou, F. Y. Wang</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magneto-ionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs), can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a $\sim 90^\circ$ PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few $\times10~\rm{rad~m^{-2}}$ between the multiple images.

  <p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magneto-ionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs), can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a $\sim 90^\circ$ PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few $\times10~\rm{rad~m^{-2}}$ between the multiple images. The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B-earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies-can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios.

A tentative CRSF at ~12.3 keV is identified in NuSTAR spectra with ~1.8-sigma. The source appears to show a persistent X-ray luminosity and an optical magnitude transition on the long timescale.

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">Pulsar wind nebula DA~495 (G65.7+1.2) has been extensively observed from radio to TeV $γ$-ray bands. We present LHAASO observations of DA~495, revealing an energy-dependent morphology, where an extended source with $r_{39}=0.19^{\circ}\pm0.02^{\circ}$ is detected by WCDA (0.4-15~TeV), and a point-like source with a 95\% upper limit of $r_{39}=0.11^{\circ}$ is observed by KM2A ($>25~\mathrm{TeV}$). The spectrum of the source extends beyond 100~TeV with a break or cutoff at a few tens of TeV. Our X-ray data analysis, based on Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, shows that the X-ray emission of DA~495 extends well to $\sim 6^{\prime}$, significantly larger than the size previously reported. The broadband spectral energy distribution across radio, X-ray and TeV $γ$-ray bands is phenomenologically described by a one-zone leptonic model, yielding an average magnetic field of $\sim$ 5 $\mathrm{μG}$, while Fermi-LAT spectral analysis indicates a likely presence of a $γ$-ray pulsar within the system. A time-dependent model, in which particle transport is convection-dominated in the inner region (within $\sim100^{\prime\prime}$) and diffusion-dominated in the outer region, successfully reproduces the observed radial profiles of X-ray surface brightness and spectral index, and also accounts for the TeV $γ$-ray emission detected by LHAASO, suggesting that DA~495 represents an evolved PWN with ongoing particle escape that gives rise to a TeV halo component -- that is, a PWN+halo system.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Main Aim of this paper is to explain the emergence of new components of pulsars at higher radio bands by implementing the Inverse Compton Scattering Mechanism. From pulsar radio observation, it is seen that a couple of pulsars reveal new emission components at higher radio frequencies, although they show single-component emission at lower frequencies. We develop a brief outline, fostering inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of the low-frequency radio photons as a vulnerable source of scattering, susceptible to explaining the evolution of new components of some radio pulsars at higher bands. We couple the conventional curvature radiation (CR) mechanism and ICS, and suggest that the spectral convolution of the flux component individually from CR and the modulated template due to the ICS scattered component can be combined to reproduce such signatures associated with the diverse morphology of the integrated pulse profile. We reproduce the beam frequency diagram, the geometrical variation of different parameters of the emission geometry, as well as the multi-frequency evolution from theory. We have suitably tuned the input parameter space and given the combination of parameters that can tune to a particular scattered frequency in tabulated form.

We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known-event flagging as well as unknown-event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog.

</h3>
<p class="entry-authors collapsible">Anshuman Verma, Asim Kumar Saha, Ritam Mallick</p>
<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The speed of sound refers to the rate at which information travels from one point to another. It is a positive quantity and bounded by causality. It is defined as the rate of change of pressure with respect to the system's density. In this article, we derive a covariant equation for the sound wave and demonstrate how the wave equation is modified in the general relativistic formalism. One can then define an effective speed of sound by attenuating the usual definition of sound speed with the gravitational metric potential. The general relativistic curvature effect is observed to reduce the speed of sound when computed inside a neutron star. This effectively makes the star relatively softer (according to the equation of state). The change in the effective sound speed can be easily visualised if one redefines the non-radial modes in terms of it. The modes do not change, but the space-time curvature reduces the amplitude of the oscillation modes. The formalism is suited for studying astrophysical compact objects.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">We presented a comprehensive multi-epoch timing and multiwavelength analysis of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar MAXI J1957+032, covering two major outbursts in 2022 and 2025. By reanalyzing the 2022 outburst data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we found the spin frequency and orbital parameters from the observations in 0.3-5 keV. For the 2025 outburst, we reported the detection of pulsations with the Einstein Probe (EP). Based on the $\sim$3-year baseline between these two outbursts, we measured a significant long-term spin-down rate of $\dotν= (-5.73 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{-14}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Assuming that the quiescent spin-down is driven by magnetic dipole radiation, we inferred a spin-down luminosity of $L \approx 1.1 \times 10^{36}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and a surface dipolar magnetic field of $B \approx (7.3 - 10.4) \times 10^8$ G. Furthermore, we conducted a deep radio pulsation search with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during the X-ray quiescent state in 2024, resulting in a non-detection with a 7$σ$ flux density upper limit of 12.3 $μ$Jy. This corresponds to a radio efficiency upper limit of $ξ< 2.8 \times 10^{-10}$, which is significantly lower than that of typical millisecond pulsars with a similar spin-down power. This profound radio pulsation faintness can be explained by two primary scenarios: either a geometric effect, wherein the pulsar's radio beam is directed away from our line of sight, or a physical suppression of the emission mechanism, potentially caused by a persistent low-level accretion flow during the X-ray quiescent state.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast ($<$1$\,$hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of $g\sim22.2$ AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g<22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.</p>

In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g<22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.</p>

<p class="entry-abstract collapsible">The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is a collaborative initiative that deploys a network of low-cost, autonomous Water Cherenkov Detectors across Latin America and Spain. Initially focused on detecting gamma-ray bursts at high-altitude sites, LAGO has evolved into a multidisciplinary forum for astroparticle physics, space weather studies, and environmental monitoring. Its detectors operate from sea level to over 4300 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) in diverse geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. The ARTI-MEIGA simulation framework is a key development that models the entire cosmic-ray interaction chain, enabling site-specific simulations to be integrated into FAIR-compliant workflows. LAGO also plays a significant role in regional education and training through partnerships with ERASMUS+ projects, positioning itself as a hub for research capacity building. New contributions emerging from the collaboration include volcano muography, neutron hydrometry for precision agriculture, and space weather monitoring in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. LAGO demonstrates how Cherenkov-based detection and open science can drive scientific discovery and practical innovation.</p>
